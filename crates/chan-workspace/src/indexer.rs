// Built-in graph indexer. Owns a watcher subscription, debounces
// per-path events, and workspaces `Workspace::index_file` / `forget_file`
// / `reconcile` so consumers (the CLI, chan-server, and the future
// Swift / Kotlin shells) do not each reinvent the same queue.
//
// Threading model:
//
//   * One worker thread per indexer, named "chan-workspace::indexer".
//   * The watcher's notify thread is the producer. It hands events
//     to the indexer through an mpsc channel via an internal
//     `WatchCallback` so the indexer thread is the only one
//     touching graph + index.
//   * Drop the `GraphIndexer` (or call `stop()`) to tear down both
//     the watcher and the worker. Cleanup is synchronous: the
//     watcher is dropped first to close the channel, then the
//     worker joined.
//
// Debouncing:
//
//   * Per-path, trailing-edge. The first event for a path schedules
//     a deadline at `now + debounce`; subsequent events for the same
//     path push the deadline forward. The deadline maturing is the
//     trigger to run `index_file`.
//   * `Removed` and the source side of `Renamed` skip the debounce
//     entirely: deletions are immediate because a stale graph row
//     pointing at a missing file is the user-visible failure mode,
//     and re-creating the same path inside the debounce window is
//     fine (the subsequent `Modified`/`Created` re-schedules the
//     deadline).
//   * `ProviderError` and path-less events (the watcher's "scope
//     unknown" signal) clear the pending map and trigger a full
//     `Workspace::reconcile`. The reconcile is the same convergence
//     path used for cold-open and offline-edit catch-up.
//
// Tests in this module exercise the FS path with a real watcher,
// so they are timing-sensitive on slower hosts; bumps to the
// `DEBOUNCE_TEST_MS` constant compound through every test.
