// Progress events for long-running drive operations.
//
// One umbrella shape used by `Workspace::reindex_with`, the rename +
// link-rewrite path, `import_contacts_with`, `Library::reset_workspace_with`,
// and the embedder model load. Consumers (chan-server's WebSocket
// fan-out, the CLI's progress bar, future native shells) build on
// `ProgressCallback` so a single sink handles every long-running op
// instead of one bespoke callback shape per surface.
//
// Design constraints:
//   * Owned String fields, no lifetimes. The public API must survive
//     the uniffi boundary later; foreign code can't hold borrowed
//     references across an FFI call.
//   * `ProgressCallback: Send + Sync`. Some ops fire from the embed
//     batch worker or from inside the graph rebuild, so the sink
//     can't assume single-threaded access. Foreign objects come in
//     as `Arc<dyn ProgressCallback>` via uniffi; deref to the &dyn
//     form the methods accept.
//   * Events are best-effort hints, not a stream contract. Dropping
//     one because the consumer is slow is fine; the on-disk state
//     is the authority. Implementations must not block (any I/O
//     work belongs on a separate worker that drains a channel).
//
// Cardinality budget per stage so consumers can sanity-check their
// progress UI without instrumenting the producer:
//
//   GraphRebuild    one per editable-text file walked
//   IndexFile       one per file before the BM25 enqueue
//   EmbedBatch      one per cross-file embedding flush
//   RenameRewrite   one per source file rewritten
//   Import          one per contact written
//   Reset           one per subsystem wiped
//   ModelLoad       one per phase boundary (resolve, download, load)
//   Heartbeat       sparse; used to keep the bar moving during
//                   silent internal phases (orphan-shard cleanup,
//                   trash sweeps)
