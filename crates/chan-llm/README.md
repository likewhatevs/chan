# chan-llm

MCP server and tool sandbox for exposing a chan workspace to local agent
tools. Filesystem access routes through `chan-workspace`, so the path
sandbox, special-file refusal, atomic writes, and editable-text gate
apply to every tool call.

The supported integration point is MCP; the crate has no in-app
chat or agent-session surface.

## Add to your project

```toml
[dependencies]
chan-llm = "0.33"

# Optional: stdio MCP server module + the `chan-llm-mcp` binary.
# Pulls rmcp + schemars; off by default.
chan-llm = { version = "0.33", features = ["mcp"] }
```

feature "mcp":
  mcp::Server::new(Arc<Workspace>)
  mcp::Server::with_max_media_bytes(bytes)
  mcp::Server::serve_stdio()
  mcp::Server::serve_io(reader, writer)
```

`read_media` is MCP-only. Text tools are also available through
`tools::execute` for tests and hosts that need direct dispatch.

## Contacts and the graph

chan-workspace maintains a sqlite link graph next to every workspace
(nodes, edges, headings, tags, contacts). The editor uses it for
the `[[` link picker, the `@` contact picker, chip rendering, and
the graph view. MCP exposes graph tools for note relationships and
BM25 search for content discovery; typed contact APIs stay in
chan-workspace.

From an agent's perspective:

  - **"Find Alice"**: `search_content "Alice"` (BM25 over bodies
    and frontmatter).
  - **"What contacts do I have?"**: `list_files` with a prefix
    that matches the contacts directory, then `read_file` on
    interesting hits.
  - **"What links to this contact?"**: use `graph_neighbors` or
    search for the filename.

## Build and test

```bash
cargo build -p chan-llm
cargo test  -p chan-llm
cargo build -p chan-llm --features mcp
```
