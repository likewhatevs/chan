//! Per-tenant session presence: the leader and followers collaborating on one
//! served workspace (one `AppState`).
//!
//! [`window_presence`](crate::window_presence) answers "is this window
//! connected somewhere" with a bare `window_id -> socket count` refcount and
//! stays underneath unchanged (the `GET /api/windows` connected flag reads it).
//! This registry layers the COLLABORATION model on top: a per-tenant set of
//! participants keyed by the same `?w=<window_id>`, each with an origin-derived
//! role (a local-origin socket reads Leader, a tunnel socket reads Follower), a
//! lifecycle state, an optional display name, and a join order. A single
//! DESIGNATED-OWNER slot (the `leader` field) is elected local-first: the
//! lowest-join-order live LOCAL participant, falling back to the lowest-join
//! live remote only when no local is present. That slot drives handover
//! routing, the launcher gate, and the aggregate leaders map; when its holder's
//! last socket drops and stays gone past the grace, the slot is re-elected the
//! same way.
//!
//! Identity is the `window_id`, not the socket: a reload drops and reopens the
//! SAME `?w=` within the grace, so it must read as "still live, same
//! participant", never a leader-loss. The registry therefore keeps its own
//! per-participant socket count (independent of `window_presence`) so a reload's
//! brief old+new overlap holds the participant `Live`, and only a real
//! disconnect arms the grace clock.
//!
//! The state machine and grace clock are PURE and time-injectable
//! ([`reap_due`](SessionRegistry::reap_due) takes `now`); the `/ws` pump drives
//! the socket count via the RAII [`SessionGuard`], and a per-tenant reaper task
//! advances disconnected -> gone and broadcasts. Handover is a blocked
//! request/reply owned by the control layer; the registry holds only the
//! at-most-one pending request so the leader's separate `cs session handover
//! --accept` connection can find it.
