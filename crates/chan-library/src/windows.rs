//! The authoritative window set: the library-owned window registry plus its
//! wire contract.
//!
//! The library is the single authority for which windows exist. Every window (a
//! standalone terminal or a workspace view) is a durable [`PersistedWindow`] in
//! the [`WindowRegistry`], keyed by a library-minted
//! [`WindowRecord::window_id`]. Clients (native desktop windows, browser tabs,
//! `cs`) are pure views: they read the window set ([`WindowSet`]) and reconcile
//! their surface to it; they never mint an id and never parse one. A client
//! brings a window into being by asking the library to mint one
//! ([`CreateWindow`]).
//!
//! Durable vs wire split. [`PersistedWindow`] is the durable on-disk row (id,
//! kind, title, ordinal, workspace path). [`WindowRecord`] is what the HTTP feed
//! serves: the durable row plus live state assembled at read time (the owning
//! library's id, the serving tenant's `prefix`/`token`, and the `connected`
//! presence flag, see [`PersistedWindow::to_record`]). So the registry owns
//! durability plus the mint; the route layer assembles the live view.
//!
//! Id scope. `window_id` is unique within its minting library only: libraries
//! mint independently, with no global authority. The globally-unique key is the
//! composite `(library_id, window_id)`, which is what a client aggregating
//! libraries keys on. Within a library, uniqueness is structural: the mint
//! re-rolls against the registry, so it never collides regardless of entropy
//! width.
