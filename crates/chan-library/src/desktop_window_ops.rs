//! Bridge from the control socket to chan-desktop's window manager.
//!
//! `cs window list` reads server-side state, but spawning, focusing,
//! closing, hiding, and renaming OS windows are desktop operations: they
//! need the Tauri `AppHandle`, which only the desktop process owns. The
//! embedded server runs in that same process but is handed no
//! `AppHandle` (and chan-server must stay Tauri-free so `chan open`
//! builds standalone). So the desktop installs a [`DesktopBridge`]: an
//! mpsc channel the control socket sends [`DesktopWindowOp`]s down, plus
//! the shared title map (see [`crate::window_titles`]). Each op carries a
//! `oneshot` the desktop completes, so the control handler can `await` a
//! result exactly like the existing window-bus round-trips — but without
//! bouncing through the SPA.
//!
//! In standalone `chan open` the channel is absent ([`DesktopBridge`]'s
//! `window_ops` is `None`); every lifecycle op then refuses with
//! [`NO_DESKTOP`]. The `None` *is* the "no desktop attached" invariant,
//! encoded in the type rather than a runtime flag.
