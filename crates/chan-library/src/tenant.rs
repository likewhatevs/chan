//! The seams between the library core and the route layer that builds tenants.
//!
//! Two traits keep `chan-server → chan-library` acyclic while the host and the
//! control socket live here:
//!
//! - [`WorkspaceCellHandle`] — how the host and the control socket reach a
//!   tenant's live workspace + its indexer, without naming `chan-server`'s
//!   `WorkspaceCell` / `Indexer` (which stay in the route layer). The route
//!   layer hands back an `Arc<dyn WorkspaceCellHandle>` over the shared cell.
//! - [`HostControl`] — the slice of the host a control-socket connection
//!   reaches through a `Weak` back-reference: unmount a tenant (`chan close`)
//!   and read the library window set (`cs window list`). Lets the control
//!   socket hold `Weak<dyn HostControl>` instead of a concrete `WorkspaceHost`.
