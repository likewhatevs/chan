//! The launcher's gateway registry boundary.
//!
//! The launcher lists and mutates the user's configured gateways, but the
//! gateway set lives in chan-desktop's config (`desktop/src-tauri/src/config.rs`),
//! which sits ABOVE chan-server in the dependency graph and is invisible from
//! here. Mirroring the [`DevserverRegistry`](crate::DevserverRegistry)
//! inversion, [`WorkspaceHost`](crate::WorkspaceHost) holds an optional
//! `Arc<dyn GatewayRegistry>` the embedder installs; the launcher routes read
//! it at request time. chan-desktop implements the trait over its config vec;
//! the headless devserver and plain `chan open` install none, so the accessor
//! returns `None` and the routes serve an empty list and 404 mutation.
//!
//! Connect/disconnect are NOT registry methods: like devserver connect, they
//! operate the desktop's live connection state and ride the desktop window-ops
//! bridge, answering the plain-text NO_DESKTOP 409 on bridge-less surfaces.
//!
//! The launcher SPA's TypeScript (`web/packages/launcher/src/api/library.ts`)
//! mirrors these serde shapes exactly; a field change here must flow to that
//! mirror in the same round of edits.
//!
//! Errors are plain `String`s: the only consumer is the route layer, which
//! turns them straight into HTTP bodies, so threading a rich error enum across
//! the chan-library / chan-server / chan-desktop boundary buys nothing.
