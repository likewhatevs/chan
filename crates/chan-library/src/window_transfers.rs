//! Live per-window transfer count: how many file uploads / downloads a
//! window currently has in flight.
//!
//! Every SPA window opens one event socket and tags it with its window
//! id (`/ws?w=<id>` -- the same id `window_presence` keys on) and reports
//! its in-flight transfer count over it (`{ "type": "transfers", "active":
//! <n> }`). The refcounted map below SUMS those counts per window id across
//! its sockets, so the desktop's close handler can ask one synchronous
//! question -- [`WindowTransfers::window_has_active_transfer`] -- before it
//! lets a window close mid-transfer, the same hold/cancel guard a window
//! with live terminal shells gets.
//!
//! Per-socket and RAII-cleared via [`TransferGuard`]: a reload drops the
//! socket AND kills its in-flight XHRs, and the guard's Drop subtracts that
//! socket's last-reported count, so a reloaded window reads inactive for
//! free -- no client message needed. Refcounted (a sum, not a boolean) so a
//! reload's brief overlap of the old and new socket of one window doesn't
//! undercount.
//!
//! Simpler than [`window_presence`](crate::window_presence): the close
//! guard is a synchronous query, not a watch, so there is no change-notify
//! here.
