//! The launcher's devserver registry boundary.
//!
//! The launcher lists and mutates the user's configured devservers, but the
//! devserver set lives in chan-desktop's config (`desktop/src-tauri/src/config.rs`),
//! which sits ABOVE chan-server in the dependency graph and is invisible from
//! here. Mirroring the [`WorkspaceOverlay`](crate::WorkspaceOverlay) inversion,
//! [`WorkspaceHost`](crate::WorkspaceHost) holds an optional
//! `Arc<dyn DevserverRegistry>` the embedder installs; the launcher routes read
//! it at request time. chan-desktop implements the trait over its config vec;
//! the headless devserver and plain `chan open` install none, so the accessor
//! returns `None` and the routes serve an empty list and 404 mutation.
//!
//! The trait lives in chan-library because `WorkspaceHost` — which holds the
//! handle — is a chan-library type, and the crate dependency only flows
//! chan-server -> chan-library, not the reverse. chan-server re-exports these so
//! its routes name them as `chan_server::Devserver*`.
//!
//! Errors are plain `String`s: the only consumer is the route layer, which turns
//! them straight into HTTP bodies, so threading a rich error enum across the
//! chan-library / chan-server / chan-desktop boundary buys nothing.
