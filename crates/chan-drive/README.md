# chan-drive

Sandboxed filesystem, full-text search, and link-graph primitives
for the chan markdown editor. One handle per drive (a directory of
notes); reads and writes go through a strict path sandbox, every
write is atomic, and a tantivy index plus a sqlite link graph
sit alongside the file tree without writing anything inside it.

## Add to your project

```toml
[dependencies]
chan-drive = "0.7"
```

Hybrid (BM25 + dense) search is on by default via the `embeddings`
feature. Disable with `default-features = false` for a BM25-only
build (iOS, minimal targets).

## Public API at a glance

  - `Library`: per-machine handle. Owns the drive registry at
    `~/.chan/config.toml` (or the platform sandbox equivalent),
    resolves OS state and cache paths, opens drives.
  - `Drive`: per-directory handle. Holds a cross-process writer
    lock for its lifetime.
    - Filesystem: `read`, `read_text`, `write_text`, `write_bytes`,
      `read_text_with_stat` + `write_text_if_unchanged` (mtime
      CAS), `stat`, `list`, `list_tree`, `create_dir`, `rename`,
      `remove` (soft-delete to trash).
    - Trash: `trash_list`, `trash_restore`, `trash_purge`,
      `trash_empty`. 30-day retention, lazy GC.
    - Search: `search`, `reindex` (sync), `index_file`,
      `forget_file`, `link_targets`, `resolve_link`.
    - Graph: `graph()` returns a `GraphView` with `neighbors`,
      `backlinks`, `tags`, `files_with_tag`, `replace_file`.
    - Watch: `watch(Arc<dyn WatchCallback>)` returns a
      `WatchHandle`; drop to stop.
    - Blob storage: `put_session` / `put_assistant` and friends
      for opaque host JSON (sessions, chat history).
  - `ChanError`: one umbrella enum, primitive payloads, FFI-safe.

All public types are owned (no lifetimes), `Send + Sync`, and
shaped for a future uniffi binding to Swift / Kotlin shells. No
public `async fn`; async runs internal to the crate where it
exists at all.

## Build and test

From the workspace root:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The Rust toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. The
`embeddings` feature pulls candle + tokenizers + hf-hub, which are
heavy first-build dependencies; `--no-default-features` skips them.
