pub(crate) const CHAN_CLOSE: &str = r#"Tear down the server holding a workspace, the inverse of `chan open`.

Finds the process holding the workspace's writer lock (from its
`writer.lock` record), reaches it over its control socket, asks it to
tear down, and waits for the flock to release. The holder decides the
scope: a dedicated `chan open` serve exits, while a chan-desktop or
`chan devserver` host unmounts just that tenant and keeps running.

Closing is idempotent. A workspace nothing is serving prints "(not
served: PATH)" and succeeds, as does one whose recorded holder is gone
or exposes no control socket. A holder that is reached but fails to
tear down is reported on stderr and treated as closed.

`--remove` then also forgets the workspace: the registry entry in
`~/.chan/config.toml` and the whole `~/.chan/workspaces/<key>/`
metadata directory, trash included. The workspace directory itself is
never touched. On a devserver or desktop host the removal is also
pushed into that host's own library, so the workspace stops coming back
in the launcher after a restart.

This is a library command, not a window command: it needs no chan
terminal and no workspace window.
"#;

/// `chan close` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CHAN_CLOSE_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
Stop serving a workspace:
  chan close ~/notes
  # closed: /home/you/notes

Close something nothing is serving -- still a success:
  chan close ~/archive
  # (not served: /home/you/archive)

Serve it no more and forget it, leaving the files on disk:
  chan close --remove ~/notes
  # closed: /home/you/notes
  # unregistered: /home/you/notes

SIDE EFFECTS:
Ends the dedicated serve process (or unmounts the tenant on a host) and
releases the workspace's writer lock, so its terminals go away with it.
With --remove, drops the registry entry and deletes
`~/.chan/workspaces/<key>/`. Progress lines go to stdout; the
"could not reach the server" warning goes to stderr.

CAUTIONS:
--remove is not reversible. It deletes chan's metadata for the
workspace -- search index, graph database, trash, saved layouts -- and
a later `chan open` on the same path starts from empty metadata. Your
files are untouched either way.

CAVEATS:
A chan-desktop or devserver host REFUSES to close a workspace that
still has live terminals: the command fails with "refusing to close
PATH: N live terminal(s)" and exits nonzero, and with --remove the
registry removal does not run either. There is no --force; close the
terminals first. A dedicated standalone serve has no such guard and
shuts down with its terminals.

SEE ALSO:
`chan open` to serve it again, `chan ps` to see what is served, `chan
workspace rm`, which also tears the server down before forgetting the
workspace.

SIDE EFFECTS:
`set` rewrites ~/.chan/preferences.toml for an `editor.*` key and
~/.chan/server.toml for a `server.*` key, creating the file on first
save; the confirmation line goes to stdout. A running server picks the
change up from its watch on that directory and pushes it to open
windows. `get` writes nothing.

CAVEATS:
Only the keys above are settable. A bare `chan config get` dumps the
full config structs, so it also shows fields the Settings overlay owns
that `set` does not expose. An empty value is refused rather than
stored, so a typo cannot silently wipe a preference.
editor.date_format is stored verbatim without validation; an id the
editor does not know renders as `iso`.

";

/// `chan devserver` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CHAN_DEVSERVER: &str = r"Serve many workspaces from one process on one address, headless.

DESCRIPTION:
A devserver aggregates workspaces behind a single port. Once it is
running, `chan open PATH` on that same box registers the workspace
with the running same-user devserver and exits instead of binding
its own server, so the devserver owns each workspace's
single-writer flock and its terminal sessions. A desktop client
lists, opens, and forgets workspaces over the management API; what
was mounted comes back on the next start.

Because the sessions live in the devserver process, a client can
disconnect and reconnect while terminals and their agents keep
running -- that is the point of running one on a remote box, a VM,
or beside your desktop.

Install chan on the target machine, then `chan devserver --start`.
A bare `chan devserver` (no action verb) runs in the FOREGROUND on
127.0.0.1:8787 until Ctrl-C. The action verbs -- --start, --stop,
--restart, --status, --join, --rotate-token -- drive a background
service instead.
--join brings the service up (or re-attaches to a running one) and
stays attached, blocking on its health until Ctrl-C, at which point
it detaches and the service keeps running; that is the form connect
scripts use.
--rotate-token re-mints the bearer token (the response to a
suspected leak) and prints the new CHAN_DEVSERVER_TOKEN= marker and
/?t= URL. A running devserver drops the old token immediately;
reopen any browser tab that used the old URL. Tokens also rotate on
their own at the first cold start after they turn 30 days old.

--service picks the backend. `auto` (the default) resolves per-OS
at runtime: with an action verb it is systemd on Linux, launchd on
macOS, and chan's own daemon on Windows; with no action verb it is
the plain foreground server. `none` forces the foreground server
and rejects action verbs. `chan` is the cross-OS self-managed
background daemon (pidfile + flock) and may run bare or with a
verb. `systemd` and `launchd` are OS-backed and REQUIRE a verb.

The devserver speaks plain HTTP with a bearer token and no TLS, so
keep the bind on loopback and reach a remote one over `ssh -L`. The
token is minted once and reused, persisted 0600 in the devserver
config; it is printed as a CHAN_DEVSERVER_TOKEN= line on stdout,
which the desktop's control terminal scrapes on every connect.
";

/// `chan devserver` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CHAN_DEVSERVER_AFTER: &str = r"EXAMPLES:
  chan devserver
    Foreground server on 127.0.0.1:8787. Prints
    CHAN_DEVSERVER_TOKEN=<token> on stdout; Ctrl-C stops it.

  chan devserver --start
    Linux: ensures lingering, writes and enables
    ~/.config/systemd/user/chan-devserver.service, starts it,
    returns. macOS: writes and bootstraps
    ~/Library/LaunchAgents/app.chan.devserver.plist. Then
    `chan open ~/src/proj` registers that workspace with it.

  ssh box -L 8787:localhost:8787 chan devserver --join
    The connect-script shape the desktop's Add-devserver dialog
    ships as its placeholder: brings the remote service up,
    forwards its port to local 127.0.0.1:8787, and stays in the
    foreground.

  CHAN_HOME=/tmp/iso XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/iso-run \
    chan devserver --port 8788
    A second, fully isolated instance beside your real one.

PER PLATFORM:
  Linux: run it directly; systemd is the default backend. For a
  SECOND isolated instance, set CHAN_HOME to a separate directory
  and pass --port. CHAN_HOME REPLACES ~/.chan (it is not a parent
  of it): registry, devserver config, tokens, per-workspace
  metadata and locks all move there. The control socket does NOT
  route through CHAN_HOME -- it lands in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (else
  /tmp) -- so a fully isolated instance needs XDG_RUNTIME_DIR set
  to its own directory too.

  macOS: run the devserver inside a Lima VM and connect to it, so
  the workspace lives on Linux. Connect script:
    limactl shell chan -- chan devserver --join
  Natively on the Mac, --service=launchd works too, but tunnel
  mode is refused there.

  Windows: --service=chan is the only backend (systemd is
  Linux-only, launchd macOS-only), and `auto` with an action verb
  resolves to it. To put the workspace on Linux, run the devserver
  inside WSL2 and connect to it.

  Any remote box: do not bind a public interface. Tunnel:
    ssh box.example.net -L 8787:localhost:8787 chan devserver --join
  Keep connect scripts in the foreground (e.g. `ssh -N`).

SIDE EFFECTS:
  Writes ~/.chan/devserver/config.json (0600, bearer token +
  its mint time; --rotate-token and the 30-day age check on a
  cold start replace the token in place),
  workspaces.json (the mount list) and terminals/; --service=chan
  and launchd also write devserver.log (systemd logs to the
  journal instead). Under CHAN_HOME all of these move with it.
  --start/--restart write and enable the systemd unit or the
  launchd plist, recording this binary's resolved path and the
  bound address; --service=chan writes daemon.lock + daemon.json
  and detaches a daemon child.
  --stop stops AND disables the systemd unit / launchd agent, so
  it does not return on the next login or boot. The unit/plist
  file stays on disk.
  The CHAN_DEVSERVER_TOKEN= marker and the --status report go to
  stdout; progress lines and warnings go to stderr.

CAUTIONS:
  A non-loopback --bind prints a warning on the foreground and
  --service=chan paths: there is no TLS, only a bearer-token gate.
  A foreground devserver started with the default environment
  SHARES ~/.chan with chan-desktop, so both contend on the same
  writer locks; a workspace the desktop already serves shows as
  Locked, not On or Off.
  --service=systemd needs lingering to survive logout; it runs
  `loginctl enable-linger` and fails loudly (with the sudo hint)
  when it is denied. A launchd agent outlives the launching shell
  and the GUI login session but NOT a full logout.
  --service=systemd --restart preserves live PTYs via the systemd
  fdstore and ABORTS if that handoff fails; --force restarts
  destructively, killing them.
  --join exits 0 when you detach with Ctrl-C, and non-zero when
  the backing service dies or stops answering /api/health.
  --tunnel-token is visible in `ps`; prefer CHAN_TUNNEL_TOKEN.

CAVEATS:
  --service=none rejects every action verb; --service=systemd and
  --service=launchd refuse to run without one.
  --service=systemd is Linux-only and --service=launchd is
  macOS-only; --service=chan is the portable fallback. On a Linux
  box with no systemd, `auto` errors and points at --service=chan.
  Tunnel mode (--tunnel-token) is refused under --service=launchd,
  because the plist would persist the token at 0644.
  Omitting --bind/--port on --restart/--join preserves the running
  service's address instead of reverting to defaults.
  `chan open <URL>` registers a devserver with chan-desktop and
  needs a running desktop; `chan open --devserver` is refused from
  inside a devserver shell, since nesting is unsupported.

pub(crate) const CHAN_OPEN_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
Serve the current directory and open the browser on it:
  chan open .
  -> "chan is ready:" plus the tokened URL on stderr; runs until Ctrl-C

Serve a subdirectory of a repository, on another port, headless:
  chan open --here --port 9000 --no-browser ~/src/proj/docs

Hand a workspace to the local devserver from a plain shell:
  chan open --devserver ~/notes
  -> selects the sole devserver or unique CHAN_HOME match, then exits

Choose one of several local devservers explicitly:
  chan open --devserver=9999 ~/notes
  chan open --devserver=http://127.0.0.1:9999 ~/notes

Register a remote devserver with the desktop app:
  chan open --name lab https://lab.example.com:8787
  -> registered "lab". Open it from the launcher.

SIDE EFFECTS:
Creates the workspace root when missing, and the standalone path
registers it in the workspace library. The directory is created only
after the route is settled, so a refused route creates nothing. A
standalone serve holds the workspace's single-writer lock for as long as
it runs, and watches the chan config directory (~/.chan, or CHAN_HOME)
for config edits. The ready URL, the non-loopback warnings, the browser
NOTE, and the update banner go to stderr; the devserver and desktop
registration confirmations go to stdout.

CAUTIONS:
The standalone form blocks in the foreground; --timeout (30s, 5m, 1h)
gives it a graceful idle shutdown. The VCS-parent refusal exits 70. With
several live devservers, chan prefers the unique one whose library root
matches this CLI's CHAN_HOME and otherwise refuses with the candidate
list. A valued --devserver refuses when that port is not live; a bare
--devserver with no live candidate keeps the standalone fallback. The
standalone default port 8787 is also `chan devserver`'s default: on a
collision chan says whether a discovered devserver of yours reports that
port. --no-token removes the only auth gate; --no-settings greys the
Settings cog and makes every settings-write route answer 403.

CAVEATS:
The URL form needs a running chan-desktop and never falls back to a
local serve -- a URL is never served locally. --devserver from inside a
devserver shell is refused (no nesting); omit the flag to register with
the current one. If another process already holds the workspace lock,
the serve fails and points you at `chan open --devserver`.

`desktop` (chan-desktop's embedded server), or `devserver` (a
multi-workspace `chan devserver`). A holder that does not answer leaves
the BY column as `-` while STATE still reads `served`.

SIDE EFFECTS:
None. Read-only, output on stdout. It does connect to each live
holder's control socket to ask what kind of server it is.

CAVEATS:
Only REGISTERED workspaces are listed; with none registered it prints
"(no workspaces registered)". A free row serializes `served_by`, `pid`
and `since` as null, and `since` appears only in --json (the table
carries STATE, BY, PID and WORKSPACE).

/// `chan workspace contacts import csv` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CHAN_WORKSPACE_CONTACTS_IMPORT_CSV: &str = r#"Import contacts from a CSV file into a workspace, one markdown note
per contact.

Reads a Google Contacts CSV (export at contacts.google.com -> Export
-> "Google CSV"), parses the whole file before touching the
workspace, and writes one note per contact into --into. Each note
carries `chan.kind: contact` frontmatter, so the indexer stamps it
as a contact node in the graph and the editor's `@@` picker finds
it. --workspace is required and auto-registers the path when the
library does not know it yet; --into is required and is created if
missing (use --into "" for the workspace root). --provider defaults
to google, the only supported dialect.

Filenames come from the contact's display name, falling back to the
email local part, then phone-<digits>, then unnamed-<n>; they are
sanitized and get a " (2)", " (3)" suffix on collision inside the
batch. A note that already exists at a contact's natural name is
skipped unless --overwrite.

The contact's data lives in the note body as bullets (Email, Phone,
Org, Labels) with the CSV notes below it, so a plain markdown editor
shows a readable note rather than a wall of YAML. In the graph a
contact is its own node kind; a lookup matches a case-insensitive
substring of the title, basename, emails or the `aliases:` array,
and `@@name` mention pills resolve through that. The import writes
no aliases: you add them by editing the note, and since a mention is
only [A-Za-z0-9_-]+, an alias containing a space can never match.

SIDE EFFECTS:
Registers the --workspace path in the library when it is not already
known, creating the directory if it does not exist. Creates the
--into directory, then writes one markdown file per contact. The
per-contact report and the totals go to stdout. --dry-run runs the
same slug and existence checks but writes nothing.

CAUTIONS:
--overwrite replaces existing notes in place, discarding hand edits
(including aliases you added). Run --dry-run first. A CSV parse
error aborts before any file is written; a per-contact write error
is reported as FAILED and the batch continues.

CAVEATS:
Only --provider google is accepted; any other value is an error.
Contacts show up in the graph and in the @@ picker only once the
index has picked the new notes up.
