# chan-server -- design

The serving layer: turns a workspace (or a terminal) into a web app, hosts the MCP sandbox, and builds the devserver. Per tenant it builds `Router::new().merge(api).fallback(serve_static)`.

## What it provides

- **Per-tenant API**: files, search, graph, drafts, and the terminal PTY WebSocket -- thin HTTP/WS over a `chan-workspace` handle.
- **`serve_static`**: serves the embedded workspace SPA per tenant with SPA fallback + `inject_chan_meta` (the `chan-prefix` / `settings-disabled` meta).
- **Launcher root**: embeds the launcher SPA and assembles the launcher bundle (the `/` SPA plus the `/api/library/{workspaces,windows}` data routes). `install_launcher_root_fallback` installs that bundle on the `chan-library` `WorkspaceHost` root fallback, so the library/devserver root serves the launcher instead of 404ing. The install is **per-surface**: the desktop loopback installs it bearer-`Some` (a minted loopback token) with full workspace mutation; the devserver installs it bearer-`None` because tunnel-origin requests have already passed the gateway edge. Missing or non-owner gateway assertions may read the launcher but cannot mutate `/api/library/*`; a signed owner assertion keeps full mutation.
- **MCP host**: hosts `chan-llm` in-process over a Unix socket (+ `chan __mcp-proxy`).
- **Graph adapter**: assembles the visualization graph while delegating authored link and mention/contact normalization to `chan-workspace`.
- **Workspace search adapter**: `POST /api/search/workspace` accepts the shared
  typed request and returns the core result unchanged. The legacy
  `/api/search/content` route is a projection over the same effective-mode
  policy. Control-socket `workspace_search` uses the same contract for `cs`.
- **Devserver builder**: `build_devserver_app` composes the `WorkspaceHost` + per-tenant apps into one merged router for `run_devserver`; `chan devserver` and the desktop loopback run the same app.

## Boundaries

- chan-server depends on `chan-library`, so the launcher assets + handlers live here (the higher layer) and are injected into chan-library's root fallback -- chan-library never references a frontend bundle.
- Launcher builds are wired into the root web build so clean CI/release builds embed a real launcher, not an empty bundle.
- Search ranking, selector resolution, traversal, normalization, limits, and
  structured partial errors stay in `chan-workspace`; HTTP and control-socket
  handlers only deserialize, choose the active tenant, and serialize.
- `Identify` reports `workspace_root` and `metadata_key` for a workspace tenant
  and omits both for terminal-only processes. Multi-workspace CLI routing must
  match both fields (plus pid) and never fall back to another same-pid tenant.
