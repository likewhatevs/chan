//! Suppress watcher events that echo our own writes.
//!
//! Every successful chan-server write to the drive (the editor's
//! save, file create, attachment upload, answer save, rename) fires
//! a notify event right back at us via the watcher. Forwarding those
//! over the WebSocket would make every save look like an external
//! edit to the frontend, which then tries to reload the buffer the
//! user is still typing in. Bad UX.
//!
//! Each chan-server write notes its path here; WatchBroadcast checks
//! membership before forwarding. Entries TTL out after 1500 ms,
//! which is the empirical headroom on macOS FSEvents + Linux inotify
//! for the OS-delivered Modify event after our atomic rename.
//!
//! Trade-off: a genuine external edit landing within 1500 ms of our
//! own write also gets suppressed. The next watcher event from the
//! external edit (if any) surfaces normally, and the editor's save
//! flow already does a CAS check on top, so the worst case is "the
//! conflict prompt fires on the user's next save instead of the
//! moment the external edit arrived".
//!
//! The membership check is read-only: an entry is NOT consumed on
//! first match. notify often emits 2-3 events per logical write
//! (especially on macOS); a pop-on-match strategy would let the
//! second/third event through and re-trigger the bad behavior.
