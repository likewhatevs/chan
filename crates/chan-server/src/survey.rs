//! The survey bus: the blocked-transport side of `cs terminal survey`.
//!
//! A `cs terminal survey` call BLOCKS in the control socket until the user
//! answers in the SPA. The control handler parks a oneshot here keyed by a
//! server-minted `survey_id` and awaits it; the SPA's reply route
//! (`POST /api/survey/reply`) deserializes the [`SurveyReply`] and calls
//! [`SurveyBus::complete_survey`], which fires the oneshot and unblocks the
//! handler. Keeping the bus and the reply route on the two ends of one
//! stable `complete_survey` API keeps their coupling narrow.
//!
//! The bus also owns the per-target survey FIFO: the SPA holds ONE overlay
//! slot per terminal tab (plus one window-wide slot), so at most one survey
//! may be OPEN per target at a time. [`SurveyBus::enqueue_turn`] admits the
//! first survey for a target immediately and parks later ones in a bounded
//! [`VecDeque`]; each caller's [`SurveyTurnGuard`] releases its slot on drop
//! (reply, timeout, cancel, or a dropped connection), promoting the next
//! survey in arrival order.
