//! `{dir}/` (e.g. `new-team-1` or `teams/alpha`). The on-disk layout
//! is:
//!
//! ```text
//! {dir}/
//!   config.toml   the TeamConfig (users may hand-edit; revalidated
//!                 on every reload)
//!   bootstrap.md  generated team-wide process doc (tool-owned;
//!                 regenerated from config.toml on every write)
//!   tasks/        task-{from}-{to}-{n}.md  (owned by `to`, append-only)
//!   journals/     journal-{member}.md      (owned by each member)
//!   followups/    followup-{from}-{to}-{n}.md (owned by `to`)
//! ```
//!
//! All file I/O routes through `Workspace::{read_text,write_text,
//! create_dir}`, so the team config lives inside the same sandbox +
//! atomic-write contract as notes content. `config.toml` and the
//! generated `.md` both pass the editable-text gate. This is the
//! reverse of the earlier design, which deliberately wrote the config
//! to a user-chosen ABSOLUTE path outside the sandbox via `std::fs`;
//! that exception is gone. The team's `.md` docs are now indexed +
//! graphed like any other workspace content.
