//! The launcher SPA root surface + the `/api/library/*` serve handlers.
//!
//! `web/packages/launcher` is a pure `/api/library/*` HTTP client served at the
//! devserver/library root `/`. chan-library's `host_dispatch` 404s the root
//! (it only matches workspace-tenant prefixes); this module builds the router
//! the embedder installs as the host's root fallback
//! (`WorkspaceHost::install_root_fallback`) so `/` serves the launcher and
//! `/api/library/*` reaches the library handles. It lives in chan-server, not
//! chan-library, because it serves a frontend bundle and the crate dependency
//! only flows chan-server -> chan-library.
//!
//! ONE bundle, installed on BOTH surfaces -- the headless devserver
//! (`build_devserver_app`) and the desktop loopback (`embedded.rs`) -- over the
//! shared [`WorkspaceHost`]. The window handlers used to live only in
//! `build_devserver_app`, which the desktop loopback never got, so the desktop
//! launcher would have been blind to its own windows; unifying them here fixes
//! that and removes the double-registration.
