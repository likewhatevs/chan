//! Filesystem graph: directories, files, symlinks, hardlinks, and
//! ghost nodes (broken or outside-workspace symlink targets, plus
//! special files like FIFOs and sockets that the content index
//! deliberately drops).
//!
//! Distinct from `/api/graph`, which describes the *semantic* graph
//! built from markdown content (file/tag/mention nodes, link/tag/
//! mention edges). This route walks the actual filesystem under the
//! workspace root and reports its shape. Same workspace sandbox invariants
//! apply: requests are lexically resolved through
//! `chan_workspace::fs_ops::resolve_safe` so `..` traversal is rejected
//! before any I/O.
//!
//! The walker uses `symlink_metadata` everywhere (lstat semantics) so
//! a symlink is never confused with the file it points at. Symlink
//! targets are classified but never traversed: their existence and
//! whether they land inside the workspace root workspaces the node kind, and
//! traversal only follows `contains` edges (parent -> child) under
//! real directories.
//!
//! Hardlinks are deduped by `(st_dev, st_ino)`. Two paths sharing the
//! same inode are surfaced as two `file` nodes joined by a
//! `hardlink` edge in addition to their parent `contains` edges.
