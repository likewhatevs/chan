//! Live Excalidraw scene sessions: the server-side authority for
//! element-level collaborative drawing.
//!
//! One `SceneSession` per attached workspace-relative path. Clients
//! push `{elements, appState?, files?}` batches; the authority merges
//! each element through the pure last-writer-wins model in [`scene`]
//! and fans the accepted values to the OTHER attachments (the sender's
//! confirmation is its `push-ok`; unlike the doc route there is no
//! own-echo, because clients reconcile content instead of replaying an
//! update log). Scene pushes always merge: there is no version gate,
//! no push-stale, and no incremental catch-up; every (re)attach gets a
//! full snapshot, tombstones included, since scenes are small next to
//! keystroke logs.
//!
//! Fan-out uses one unbounded mpsc outbox per attachment, and every
//! server->client frame is enqueued while the session state lock is
//! held, so each socket sees a strict per-session FIFO. The wire
//! shapes come from `crate::routes::scene`, the single source for the
//! scene ws contract.
//!
//! While a session is live the server is the single writer to disk:
//! the flusher debounces dirty sessions to atomic CAS writes of the
//! scene file form, and the reconciler folds external writes back in
//! through the replace semantics (bumped versions and tombstones that
//! win client-side reconciliation) instead of raising the "changed on
//! disk" banner. Because a filesystem's mtime and read-after-write
//! cannot be trusted to identify our own flush echoes (network FUSE
//! mounts re-stamp mtime and serve stale/empty reads), the reconciler
//! also checks raw disk bytes against the session's
//! [`DiskEchoRing`] and defers suspicious fold-ins until a second
//! observation corroborates them, mirroring doc_sessions.
//!
//! State locks are std mutexes with short critical sections, never
//! held across await; lock order is registry map, then session state.
//! Each session additionally has an async `io_lock` serializing its
//! flush and reconcile disk IO end to end, acquired before any state
//! lock and held across those awaits; see the doc_sessions module doc
//! for the race it prevents.
