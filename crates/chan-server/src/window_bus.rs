//! The window bus: the blocked-transport side of the `cs pane` round-trip.
//!
//! `cs pane` needs a REPLY from the SPA (the layout lives only in the
//! frontend), so the control handler cannot answer synchronously the way
//! `cs term list` does. It mirrors the `cs terminal survey` mechanism
//! (`survey.rs`) one-for-one: the handler mints a `request_id`, parks a
//! oneshot here, pushes a `pane_query` window_command carrying that id, and
//! AWAITS the oneshot. The SPA reads its `layout`, then
//! `POST /api/window/reply` deserializes the `{ requestId, payload }` body
//! and calls [`WindowBus::complete`], which fires the oneshot and unblocks
//! the handler with the payload.
//!
//! Kept on the same `Arc<WindowBus>`-on-`AppState` shape as `SurveyBus`
//! (created in `lib.rs`, passed to the control socket for the `register` +
//! `await` side, cloned onto `AppState` for the reply route's `complete`
//! side) so the two round-trip buses read identically. The reply payload is
//! an opaque `serde_json::Value` so the QUERY (returns the layout) and the
//! future EXEC ops (return a success/partial result) share one bus.
