const SURVEY_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
Each case shows the invocation and the JSON survey the SPA receives.
`surveyId` is empty from the CLI; the server mints it before the SPA sees
it. Every overlay shows the options PLUS [F] (follow up) and Dismiss, so
the blocking call prints one of: the chosen option label; the new followup
file path on [F] when `--followup-dir` context was passed (else a bare "host
deferred" line); or "survey dismissed" when the host drops it.

IMPORTANT: an [F] followup file is created EMPTY (the original question plus an
empty comments section). It means "deferred, not ready" -- NOT an actionable
answer. The host must WRITE their decision into the file's comments section
before an agent acts on it. An agent that gets a followup path should re-read
the file later and act ONLY once the host has populated it.

Single question, two options:
  cs terminal survey --tab-name @@Alice \
    --title "Merge order" --option "A first" --option "B first" \
    "Which patch lands first?"

  {
    "surveyId": "",
    "title": "Merge order",
    "bodyMarkdown": "Which patch lands first?",
    "options": ["A first", "B first"],
    "followup": null
  }

Four options, no title, multi-line body from stdin:
  printf 'Pick a slot:\n\n- morning\n- evening' \
    | cs terminal survey --tab-group leads --stdin \
        --option Mon --option Tue --option Wed --option Thu

  {
    "surveyId": "",
    "title": null,
    "bodyMarkdown": "Pick a slot:\n\n- morning\n- evening",
    "options": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu"],
    "followup": null
  }

With an [F] follow-up paper-trail file (from <- $CHAN_TAB_NAME, to <- the
survey target); passing --followup-dir is what makes [F] write the file:
  cs terminal survey --tab-name @@Host \
    --option "Ship it" --option "Hold" \
    --followup-dir teams/alpha \
    "Ready to cut v0.23.0?"

  {
    "surveyId": "",
    "title": null,
    "bodyMarkdown": "Ready to cut v0.23.0?",

const TEAM_AFTER_HELP: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
A team is one config.toml (the on-disk `{dir}/config.toml` shape). Members
are 1..=9, exactly one `is_lead = true`. The submit-encoding agent
(claude / codex / gemini) is DERIVED from each member's `command`: a loose
whole-word match, so `claude --resume` or `/usr/local/bin/codex-cli` resolve.
A command that matches none is a plain shell member (no submit chord). To
force the agent for an unorthodox launcher, set `CHAN_AGENT` in the member's
env (claude/codex/gemini, or none/shell to force a shell). `created_at` is
optional: the server stamps the current time when it is omitted.

  # myteam.toml
  team_name   = "alpha"
  host_name   = "Neo"
  host_handle = "@@Neo"
  tab_group   = "alpha"

  [[members]]
  handle  = "@@Lead"
  command = "claude"
  is_lead = true

  [[members]]
  handle  = "@@Alice"
  command = "codex"

  # A custom launcher the command can't reveal: name the agent explicitly.
  [[members]]
  handle  = "@@Bob"
  command = "./my-agent.sh"
  env     = { CHAN_AGENT = "gemini" }

Write the team (config.toml + the server-regenerated bootstrap.md + the
tasks/journals/followups tree) inside the workspace at `alpha/`:
  cs terminal team new alpha --config myteam.toml

Preview the WHOLE bootstrap as a runnable shell script (mutates nothing;
prints to stdout). Run it from a chan terminal at the workspace root to
spawn the team:
  cs terminal team new alpha --config myteam.toml --script

Pipe the config in instead of a file:
  cat myteam.toml | cs terminal team new alpha --stdin

Emit the bootstrap script for an already-written team:
  cs terminal team load alpha --script
