//! The per-agent submit-encoding map plus the command -> agent derivation.
//! A coding agent running inside a chan terminal submits its compose buffer
//! on a different byte sequence depending on which agent it is, so a
//! hands-free completion poke (`cs terminal write --submit=<agent>`) has to
//! append the right one.
//!
//! Two things live here, both shared by the `cs` CLI and chan-server:
//!
//!   - `SubmitAgent::derive`: map a spawn command (+ an optional `CHAN_AGENT`
//!     env override) to the agent whose submit encoding it uses. This is the
//!     single source of truth for "which agent is this", mirrored in
//!     `web/packages/workspace-app/src/state/teamDialog.svelte.ts` (`agentForMember`).
//!   - `apply_submit_chord`: turn a poke into the PTY bytes that submit it.
//!     Each agent has a `{}`-templated chord whose DEFAULT reproduces the
//!     live-probed bytes, but which is overridable at runtime (env var or
//!     `<config>/chan/submit.toml`) so a client changing its submit behavior
//!     does not need a rebuild. See `apply_submit_chord` / `set_chord_overrides`.
//!
//! Rich Prompt sends the agent NAME and the server applies the chord. The SPA's
//! `submitMode.ts` also pins the byte map for browser-side parity tests, so its
//! agent union, detection, and default encodings must stay in sync.
