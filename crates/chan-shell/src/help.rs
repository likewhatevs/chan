pub(crate) const CS_COPY: &str = r"Copy stdin onto the clipboard of the machine viewing this window.

The clipboard is the VIEWING machine's, not the machine running the
shell. Copy inside a workspace served from a devserver and Cmd+V pastes
it into a local app. chan stores nothing of its own: the bytes go
straight to that machine's browser or desktop clipboard, which is also
why moving content between two workspaces works -- both windows reach
the same system clipboard.

The content type is sniffed from the bytes, in order: an image by magic
bytes, then an HTML document (leading <!doctype html> or <html>), then
plain UTF-8 text. A non-PNG image is re-encoded to PNG in the window,
the one image format the clipboard reliably accepts. --html forces
text/html for a fragment that would not sniff as a document; --mime
forces any type. Bytes that match none of the three are refused with a
hint to pass --mime.
";

/// `cs copy` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_COPY_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
  cs copy < photo.jpg
    Puts the image on the clipboard; prints "copied 51234 bytes
    (image/jpeg)" on stderr. It arrives as PNG.
  git log --oneline -20 | cs copy
    Copies the text; Cmd+V pastes it into any local app.
  printf '<b>bold</b>' | cs copy --html
    Copies it as rich text, with a plain-text fallback alongside.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  Reads stdin to EOF, then BLOCKS until the window acknowledges the
  write. Mutates the viewing machine's system clipboard. The ack
  ("copied N bytes (<mime>)") goes to stderr; stdout stays empty.

CAUTIONS:
  After 2 seconds with no reply it prints a waiting notice on stderr
  (a browser may be showing a clipboard permission prompt) and keeps
  waiting; the server gives up at 30 seconds and the CLI exits 124.
  Payloads are capped at 32 MB. Empty stdin, an over-cap payload,
  unsniffable bytes, and a forced --mime text/* over non-UTF-8 bytes
  all fail with exit 1.

CAVEATS:
  --html and --mime are mutually exclusive. The target is the window
  named by $CHAN_WINDOW_ID, so the clipboard that changes belongs to
  whoever is looking at that window, not to this shell's host.

  appended to the window's active pane, becomes the active tab, and

CAUTIONS:
  Fire-and-forget: it returns as soon as the request is queued, so
  exit 0 does not prove the tab rendered. Each run appends another
  Dashboard tab; they stack.

  --carousel-off is per tab: it does not change the workspace-wide
  carousel preference, so other dashboards keep rotating.

/// `cs download` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_DOWNLOAD: &str = r#"Download a file or directory through this window.

The same UI the Inspector's download action uses: the transfer bubble
shows progress and the bytes land on the machine VIEWING the window
(its browser download, or the desktop app's download flow). That is
what makes it a way to pull files off a devserver box.

PATH is required; "." is the terminal's current directory. A directory
downloads as a tar named <leaf>.tar, built and streamed on the fly with
nothing staged on disk first. In a workspace window the source is
resolved workspace-relative, must stay inside the workspace root, and
its tar skips .chan and .git; in a standalone terminal the source is
the absolute path the shell itself can reach and is pre-flighted
readable before any archive work begins.
"#;

/// `cs download` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_DOWNLOAD_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
  cs download notes/plan.md
    Downloads the single file.
  cs download .
    Downloads the current directory as <leaf>.tar.
  cs download build/out.bin
    Any file type works here, unlike cs open, which refuses binaries.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  Queues ONE window command and returns; the transfer runs in the
  window. The ack ("download request queued for <path>") goes to
  stderr. Nothing is written on this machine.

CAUTIONS:
  Fire-and-forget once queued: exit 0 means the window was asked, not
  that the file arrived. A source that cannot be stat'ed fails before
  anything is queued, with exit 1. Cancelling from the transfer
  bubble aborts the stream mid-tar.

CAVEATS:
  Works in workspace windows and standalone terminals, with the same
  root asymmetry as cs upload: workspace-relative and walled at the
  workspace root in one, plain filesystem paths under the shell's own
  reach in the other. Failures after the transfer starts surface in
  the window, not on this terminal.

/// `cs export` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_EXPORT: &str = r"Render a workspace file through a live renderer window and write the
result back into the workspace.

`cs export doc.md` reads doc.md from the workspace, renders it in an
open workspace window (a connected browser or chan-desktop), uploads
the bytes back into the workspace, and prints the final
workspace-relative output path on stdout. The default output swaps
the source extension for the format: notes/doc.md -> notes/doc.pdf.
`pdf` is the only registered format today.

The rendering happens in the window, not in the terminal running cs:
the format-to-exporter registry lives in the frontend. The server
sends the job to the latest-joined live workspace window.

What comes out depends on the source's frontmatter. A markdown file
carrying `chan.kind: slides` exports as a deck: one slide per A4
landscape page, split at every page break. Anything else exports as
a document: A4 portrait, 0.65in margins, paginated at block
boundaries and forced at every page break. Mermaid fences,
Excalidraw embeds and images render into the PDF the way the editor
shows them.

Authoring conventions the exporter honors:
  - a code fence tagged `mermaid` renders as a diagram; tag it
    `mermaid-to-excalidraw` for the hand-drawn style
  - `@pagebreak` alone on a line is a page break (in a deck, the
    start of the next slide)
  - `chan.kind: slides` frontmatter turns the file into a deck
";

/// `cs export` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_EXPORT_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
Export a document. Prints the output path; doc.pdf lands next to it:

  cs export notes/doc.md
  notes/doc.pdf

Export a deck to a chosen path (one landscape page per slide):

  cs export decks/kickoff.md --format pdf --out out/kickoff.pdf
  out/kickoff.pdf

A deck is a markdown file with this frontmatter. `slides:` and both
of its fields are optional; aspect_ratio is "16:9" or "4:3" (any
other value exports the file as a document, not a deck) and
zoom_factor is a positive multiplier (a percentage like 150% also
works):

  ---
  chan:
    kind: slides
    slides:
      aspect_ratio: "16:9"
      zoom_factor: 2
  ---

  # Slide 1

  content

  @pagebreak

  # Slide 2

Page breaks: `@pagebreak` alone on a line splits a deck into slides
and forces a document page cut. In the editor, typing @pagebreak or
@break followed by Space or Enter rewrites the line to the page-break
atom (an <hr class="chan-page-break">), which the exporter treats the
same way. `@break` is only that typing macro: left literally in the
source (written there by an agent, say) it does NOT split.

Diagrams: put the graph in a code fence tagged `mermaid`, or
`mermaid-to-excalidraw` for the hand-drawn style. Rendering is
client-side, in the window that runs the export:

  (fence tagged mermaid)
  flowchart LR
    spec --> draft --> review

Editor conveniences worth knowing while authoring:

  [[         file picker; commits [[target]]
  [[file#    heading picker inside that file
  @@name     contact picker; commits an @@name mention pill
  @today     inserts today's date
  @date      same, plus the calendar / format popover
  ![         image picker; commits ![](path)

SIDE EFFECTS:
Writes the output file into the workspace through the upload route,
replacing an existing file at that path. Pushes an export job to the
chosen window; that window does the reading, rendering and upload.
The output path goes to stdout; errors go to stderr.

CAUTIONS:
Blocks until the renderer replies. The server gives up after 90s with
"no reply from the renderer within 90s"; inside the renderer each page
has its own 30s render ceiling. Any failure exits nonzero with the
renderer's own message. An existing output file is replaced without
asking.

CAVEATS:
Workspace windows only: a terminal-only session refuses with "cs
export is only available in a workspace window; this is a standalone
terminal.", pointing at the open window that would do the rendering.
It also refuses when no window is connected -- there is no headless
export. An unregistered --format value is rejected by the renderer,
not by the server. With several windows open the latest-joined live
one renders, which may not be the one you are looking at.

/// `cs graph` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_GRAPH: &str = r#"Open the workspace graph in the calling window.

The graph is the workspace's link structure. Files, contact notes
included, are the stored nodes; wiki-links, markdown links, #tag and
@@mention edges are stored per file as link / tag / mention edges.
Directory containment and per-file language are NOT stored: they are
derived at query time from the workspace catalog and the maintained
report, so folder and language nodes appear without ever being written
to the graph.

Bare `cs graph` opens the graph at workspace scope. With PATH it focuses
that file or directory; PATH is resolved against the terminal's cwd and
must be inside the workspace.

The tab is opened in the window named by $CHAN_WINDOW_ID over
$CHAN_CONTROL_SOCKET. Workspace windows only: a standalone terminal
refuses with "cs graph is only available in a workspace window; this is
a standalone terminal."

Navigating the tab: drag the background to pan, wheel to zoom toward the
cursor, drag a node to move it. A click selects a node and opens the
inspector; a double-click on a directory node expands or collapses its
children in place. Re-rooting is the inspector's "Graph from here",
which spawns a NEW graph tab; the ancestor breadcrumb re-scopes the
current tab in place. Right-click opens the tab menu, which carries the
Depth slider and the node-type filter chips (tag, contact, language,
media, folder, markdown, source), each with its count.

markdown editor, .excalidraw in the drawing canvas, .json in the
collapsible tree, .csv / .tsv in the table, and every other text format
in source mode. A path that does not exist yet is created as an empty
file and opened, as long as its name is a text-class name. An argument
starting with chan://graph? (the string a graph tab's "Copy link to

filesystem.

Workspace windows only, and the path must resolve inside the workspace

CAVEATS:
  A file whose bytes are not text is refused with "cannot open binary

/// `cs pane` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_PANE: &str = r"Read or change a window's pane and tab layout from a terminal.

DESCRIPTION:
A window's screen area is a tree of split panes; each pane holds a
stack of tabs (files, terminals, and the other tab kinds) with one
active tab, and exactly one pane is active. Bare `cs pane` reports
that layout: one `## pane <id>` section per pane, the active pane
flagged, a table of its tabs with `*` on the pane's active tab, and
a flags column carrying `dirty` (unsaved file) or `live` (running
terminal). An empty pane prints `(empty)`. `--json [--pretty]`
emits the raw snapshot instead: an `activePaneId` plus `panes`,
each with `id`, `active`, `side`, `activeTabId` and its `tabs`.

The subcommands mutate that layout: focus, split right|bottom,
resize by a signed ratio delta, close-tab, close-pane, close-all.
Each is one round-trip to the live window, which applies the op and
replies with a summary plus any blocked tabs.

The target is the caller's own window ($CHAN_WINDOW_ID) by default,
or the window owning `--tab-name <name>`, which lets `cs pane` run
from a context that exports no window id. Workspace windows and
standalone terminal windows both accept pane commands.
";

/// `cs pane` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_PANE_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
  cs pane
    the layout report: one section per pane, `*` on the pane's
    active tab, `dirty` / `live` in the flags column

  cs pane --json --pretty
    the same snapshot as JSON, for scripting

  cs pane --tab-name @@Alice
    the layout of whichever live window owns that tab

Build a two-pane layout and put a named terminal in the new pane. A
scripted split does NOT move focus, and a new terminal always opens
in the ACTIVE pane, so focus the new pane first:

  cs pane split right
    -> "split pane pane-1 right"
  cs pane --json
    read the new pane's id out of `panes`
  cs pane focus pane-4
    -> "focused pane pane-4"
  cs terminal new --tab-name @@Runner
    the terminal lands in pane-4
  cs pane focus pane-1
    hand focus back to where you started

  cs pane resize 0.1 --pane pane-4
    grows pane-4 inside its enclosing split; the ratio clamps to
    0.1..0.9, and a sole pane reports "single pane, nothing to
    resize"

SIDE EFFECTS:
  A mutation changes the live layout, is visible immediately, and
  schedules a save of the window's session, so it survives a
  reload. The close ops discard tabs. The report (or the exec
  summary and its `blocked:` list) goes to stdout; errors go to
  stderr.

CAUTIONS:
  Every call blocks on the window's reply and gives up after 5s
  with "no reply from the window (is it open in a browser?)" --
  which is what a window whose browser tab was closed looks like.
  A close blocked by an unsaved file or a live terminal still
  prints its summary and the blocked tabs, then exits non-zero.
  `--force` closes past unsaved edits and live terminals; no UI
  confirm dialog is raised on either path.

CAVEATS:
  With neither $CHAN_WINDOW_ID nor `--tab-name` the command
  refuses: "cs pane needs a target: run inside a chan terminal
  ($CHAN_WINDOW_ID) or pass --tab-name". A `--tab-name` owned by
  more than one live window is refused, not guessed.
  Closing the last pane clears its tabs instead of removing it: a
  window always keeps one pane.
  Subcommand names infer, but `cs pane c` is ambiguous between
  close-tab, close-pane and close-all.

/// `cs paste` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_PASTE: &str = r#"Write the clipboard of the machine viewing this window to stdout.

Same viewing-machine rule as cs copy: the bytes come off the system
clipboard of whoever is looking at the window, which is what makes
"Cmd+C locally, cs paste inside a devserver workspace" work, and what
lets one workspace pick up what another one copied.

Output is RAW bytes, so 'cs paste > shot.png' yields a real PNG. With
no flag the preference is image first, then plain text; HTML is never
chosen automatically. --text, --html and --image each force one
representation. The emitted MIME is reported on stderr so a redirect
to a file stays clean.

    Writes the clipboard image; prints "image/png" on stderr.
  cs paste --text > snippet.txt
    Forces the plain-text representation.
  cs paste --html > rich.html
    Takes the rich-text representation instead of the image.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  BLOCKS on a clipboard read in the window, then writes the raw bytes
  to stdout and the MIME to stderr. Nothing is written to disk and
  the clipboard is not modified.

CAUTIONS:
  Do not dump it to a live TTY: clipboard text can carry control and
  escape sequences. Redirect to a file, or pipe through a sanitizer.
  After 2 seconds with no reply the CLI prints a waiting notice; a
  browser that needs a user gesture raises a paste card in the window
  whose [Paste] button carries the click the read wants. An
  unanswered request ends at the server's 30-second bound and the CLI
  exits 124. Payloads are capped at 32 MB.

CAVEATS:
  --text, --html and --image are mutually exclusive. A forced

  is empty" (exit 1) rather than falling back to another one.

One request covers three things: lexical content search, entity browsing,
and graph traversal from typed seeds. A plain QUERY searches content and
every entity domain at depth 0. `--from` seeds are exact and default to
one hop. A non-content `--domain` with no query browses that entity kind.

Selectors are TYPE:VALUE, TYPE one of file, directory, tag, mention,
contact, language:

  file:notes/design.md        workspace-relative path
  directory:crates/chan-server   `directory:.` is the root

  language:Rust               needs a maintained report

--domain takes those same six names plus `content`.

Relationship kinds: link, tag and mention come from the stored graph;
language and contains are derived at query time. --direction auto (the
default) resolves per seed -- out for file and directory seeds, both for
tag, mention, contact and language seeds; out, in and both override it
for every seed.

Markdown by default (## Content, ## Entities, ## Graph, ## Warnings, ##

CAUTIONS:

  max clamps to it and adds a "<field> was clamped from N to M" line
  under ## Warnings instead of failing. --limit applies to content
  hits and entity matches independently. Structured errors still
  print their ## Errors section, then exit nonzero.

CAVEATS:
  Workspace windows only: a standalone terminal refuses with "cs

/// `cs session` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_SESSION: &str = r"Inspect a shared workspace session and move its leadership.

DESCRIPTION:
Every window connected to a workspace is a participant in one shared
session, and exactly one participant leads it. `list` prints the
roster (window, name, role, status) as markdown, or as records with
`--json [--pretty]`. Bare `self` is the whoami: your window, name,
role, status, whether you lead, and your gateway identity when one
was asserted. `self --name <name>` renames you in the roster (it
renames the participant, not the terminal tab); `self --reset`
clears that name back to your gateway identity or generated
default.

`handover` is the polite path: a follower asks the leader for
leadership (`--to <window>` names a different beneficiary) and
BLOCKS until the leader answers or the timeout runs out. The leader
can answer from its own terminal with `handover --accept` /
`handover --reject`. `takeover` is the unilateral path: it succeeds
only when the leader is gone, unless `--force`.

Workspace windows only. `list` needs $CHAN_CONTROL_SOCKET; `self`,
`handover` and `takeover` additionally need $CHAN_WINDOW_ID, since
they act as that participant.

  cs session self --name Alice

  cs session handover --timeout 60
    blocks up to 60s, then prints "handover accepted; <window> now
    leads" or "handover rejected"

  cs session takeover --force
    -> "you are now the leader", seized from a live leader

SIDE EFFECTS:
  A rename, a reset, an accepted handover and a takeover all
  rebroadcast the session roster, so every connected window sees
  the change. A handover REQUEST pushes a prompt into the leader's
  window. Each mutation prints one line on stdout; the queries
  print their table.

CAUTIONS:
  `handover` blocks: 30s by default, `--timeout <secs>` to change
  it. When nobody answers it prints "no answer within Ns" and exits
  124; the pending request is dropped, so a late answer finds
  nothing waiting.
  Only one handover is allowed in flight: a second gets "another
  handover is already in flight".
  `takeover --force` seizes leadership from a LIVE leader with no
  prompt and no confirmation.

CAVEATS:
  All four actions refuse on a standalone terminal: "cs session
  <action> is only available in a workspace window; this is a
  standalone terminal. Standalone terminals have no shared session
  to lead."
  A plain `takeover` against a live leader is refused ("the leader
  is live; ask with `cs session handover`, or seize it with
  `--force`"), and `handover` against a disconnected leader is
  refused the other way ("the leader is not connected; use `cs
  session takeover` instead").

Every chan-spawned terminal is a session in the server's registry,
tagged with a tab name ($CHAN_TAB_NAME, when the tab is named) and a
group ($CHAN_TAB_GROUP, "default" when unset). Those two are the
selectors: --tab-name matches every session with exactly that name,
--tab-group matches every session in that group, and passing both
narrows to the intersection. write, restart and close require at
least one selector, so a forgotten filter cannot fan out to every
terminal by accident; scrollback takes --tab-name only and demands a
single match.

Selection is server-wide, not window-scoped: write, list, restart,
close and scrollback reach every live session this server owns,
whichever window (or none) hosts it. Of those, none targets a
window; `new` does, the caller's own, via $CHAN_WINDOW_ID. Every
subcommand needs $CHAN_CONTROL_SOCKET.

Subcommand prefixes infer, so `cs t n` / `cs t w` / `cs t l` are
terminal new / write / list.

A standalone terminal (the workspace-less terminal tenant) supports
ALL of this: tab names, groups, the write queue, restart, close and
scrollback. Only `terminal new --path` and `terminal team` refuse
there, both for want of a workspace root. That makes a standalone
terminal fully automatable and the right place to manage the chan
library itself (`chan open`, `chan close`, `chan close --remove`,
`chan ps`), while real work belongs in a workspace window, where the
launcher, the apps and the workspace-only cs commands (open, graph,
search, export, session, terminal team) exist.

  cs terminal list
    every live session, grouped, as a markdown table

  cs terminal new --tab-name @@Alice --tab-group alpha

  cs terminal write --tab-group alpha $'git status\n'
    runs the command in every tab of group alpha

  cs terminal close --tab-group alpha
    tears the whole group down and frees its tab names

THE RICH PROMPT (typing INTO an agent by hand):
`cs terminal write` is the programmatic way to put text in front of an
agent. The Rich Prompt is the human one: a floating markdown composer
over the bottom of a terminal, for input too long or too rich to type
at a raw prompt. Toggle it with Cmd+Shift+P (Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux and
Windows), or "Show/Hide Rich Prompt" in the command launcher.

It edits a real per-terminal draft with the same editor file tabs use,
so PASTING AN IMAGE works: the image lands as a markdown embed and
renders in the composer straight away. Cmd+Enter (Ctrl+Enter) submits.

On submit, each image embed is delivered to the agent as the bare
ABSOLUTE on-disk path, not the `![](...)` markdown -- so an agent that
reads the line gets a path it can open, while the composer keeps
showing you the picture. That is how you hand an agent a screenshot.

Submissions ride the same per-terminal queue as `cs terminal write`,
so a poke from another terminal cannot interleave with what you are
typing.

CAVEATS:
  Tab names are not unique: several sessions can carry the same
  name, in which case write / restart / close hit every holder and
  scrollback refuses as ambiguous.

  On a standalone terminal, `cs terminal new --path` and `cs
  terminal team` refuse with "only available in a workspace window;
  this is a standalone terminal". There is no env var that tells a
  workspace window from a standalone terminal, so that refusal is
  the honest signal.

CAUTIONS:
  The output is raw PTY bytes, control and escape sequences

(--tab-name and/or --tab-group) is required, plus 1..=4 --option values
and a markdown body (positional words, or --stdin for multi-line).

The reply goes to STDOUT so it captures cleanly in $(...): the chosen
option label, "new follow up file created: <path>" on [F] with
--followup-dir, "host deferred; no follow up file created" on [F]
without it, or "survey dismissed; no answer". A timeout prints to stderr
and exits 124, leaving stdout empty.

This is how an agent reaches a human here: a window overlay, not a TUI
prompt. Works in a workspace window and in a standalone terminal alike
-- what it needs is a live window owning the target tab.
"#;

/// `cs terminal survey` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_TERMINAL_SURVEY_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
Each case shows the invocation and the JSON survey the SPA receives.
`surveyId` is empty from the CLI; the server mints it before the SPA sees
it. Every overlay shows the options PLUS [F] (follow up) and Dismiss, so
the blocking call prints one of: the chosen option label; the new
followup file path on [F] when `--followup-dir` context was passed (else
a bare "host deferred" line); or "survey dismissed" when the host drops
it.

IMPORTANT: an [F] followup file is created EMPTY (the original question
plus an empty comments section). It means "deferred, not ready" -- NOT an
actionable answer. The host must WRITE their decision into the file's
comments section before an agent acts on it. An agent that gets a
followup path should re-read the file later and act ONLY once the host
has populated it.

Single question, two options:
  cs terminal survey --tab-name @@Alice \
    --title "Merge order" --option "A first" --option "B first" \
    "Which patch lands first?"

  {
    "surveyId": "",
    "title": "Merge order",
    "bodyMarkdown": "Which patch lands first?",
    "options": ["A first", "B first"],
    "followup": null
  }

Four options, no title, multi-line body from stdin:
  printf 'Pick a slot:\n\n- morning\n- evening' \
    | cs terminal survey --tab-group leads --stdin \
        --option Mon --option Tue --option Wed --option Thu

  {
    "surveyId": "",

    "bodyMarkdown": "Pick a slot:\n\n- morning\n- evening",
    "options": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu"],
    "followup": null
  }

With an [F] follow-up paper-trail file (from <- $CHAN_TAB_NAME, to <- the
survey target); passing --followup-dir is what makes [F] write the file:
  cs terminal survey --tab-name @@Host \
    --option "Ship it" --option "Hold" \
    --followup-dir teams/alpha \
    "Ready to cut v0.23.0?"

    "options": ["Ship it", "Hold"],
    "followup": { "dir": "teams/alpha", "from": "@@Alice", "to": "@@Host" }
  }

SIDE EFFECTS:
  - Opens an overlay in every window owning a matching tab; the first
    reply wins and the stale overlays in the other windows are closed.
  - With --followup-dir, [F] makes the server create
    {dir}/followups/followup-{from}-{to}-{n}.md (question + an EMPTY
    comments section) inside the workspace, named with the bare
    handles (no @@).
  - The answer / followup path / dismissal line goes to stdout; the
    timeout notice goes to stderr.

CAUTIONS:
  - BLOCKS. Default --timeout is 600 seconds; on elapse it prints
    "no reply within <secs>s" to stderr and exits 124.
  - Surveys addressed to the same target run ONE at a time: a later one
    waits in a per-target FIFO (cap 100 open plus waiting) and only
    opens once the earlier ones resolve. --timeout bounds the TOTAL
    wait, so a survey can time out while still queued, without ever
    opening an overlay. Past the cap the call is refused outright.
  - Keep it to one decision and up to 4 options. Batch or sequence
    several pending questions instead of firing many tiny surveys.

CAVEATS:
  - --tab-name must match a live tab of the window you want the overlay
    in; a selector matching no live session is an error. When the host
    has no tab of their own, target the lead's tab (or the team's group)
    and pass --to=@@Host so an [F] follow-up is addressed to the host
    rather than to the proxy tab: --to overrides --tab-name for the
    follow-up's `to`.
  - --from / --to only matter with --followup-dir. `from` is
    $CHAN_TAB_NAME, with --from used only when that is unset or empty;
    `to` is --to, else --tab-name, else --tab-group.
  - An empty followup file is a DEFERRAL, not an answer. Do not act on
    it until the host has written into it.

/// `cs terminal team` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_TERMINAL_TEAM: &str = r"Create, load and bring up a team of agent terminals from one config.

A team is one workspace-relative directory. `new` validates the config
you hand it, writes {dir}/config.toml, regenerates {dir}/bootstrap.md,
creates the tasks/ journals/ followups/ tree, then spawns the members
lead-first and pokes each agent its identity prompt. `load` re-reads an
existing {dir}/config.toml and spawns the same team again. `--script` on
either prints the whole bootstrap as a runnable shell script instead of
mutating anything. This is the CLI equivalent of the Cmd+P Team Work
dialog.

The config carries team_name, host_name, host_handle, tab_group and 1
to 9 [[members]], exactly one of them is_lead. Each member has a handle
(it becomes the tab's $CHAN_TAB_NAME), a command and optional env. The
submit-encoding agent is DERIVED from the command by loose whole-word
match (claude / codex / gemini / opencode); set CHAN_AGENT in a
member's env to force it for an unorthodox launcher. A command matching
none is a plain shell member: it spawns, but gets no submit chord and
no identity poke.

The generated bootstrap.md is what every member reads. It already
carries the roster (each peer's handle, launch command, derived agent
and role), the hold-until-poked rule, the task-file protocol under
tasks/, the per-member journal, the between-tasks queue-draining
discipline, and how the lead reaches the host with `cs terminal survey`.
Pass `--brief FILE` on `new` to fold a round's own operating
instructions VERBATIM into bootstrap.md as its own section after the
Roster -- that is the normal way to give a team its work, and it
survives a regenerate, unlike hand-editing the generated file.

Working as a team's host is different from working 1:1 with one agent.
The generated bootstrap sets the shape: the host sets scope and is
reached through the lead; the lead distributes tasks, sequences the
work and aggregates requests for the host; workers do not contact the
host directly.

Workspace windows only, including --script: a standalone terminal has no
workspace tree to seed a team into. The team's .md files are indexed and
graphed like any other workspace content.
";

/// `cs terminal team` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_TERMINAL_TEAM_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
A team is one config.toml (the on-disk `{dir}/config.toml` shape).
Members are 1..=9, exactly one `is_lead = true`. The submit-encoding
agent (claude / codex / gemini / opencode) is DERIVED from each member's
`command`: a loose whole-word match, so `claude --resume` or
`/usr/local/bin/codex-cli` resolve. A command that matches none is a
plain shell member (no submit chord). To force the agent for an
unorthodox launcher, set `CHAN_AGENT` in the member's env (claude /
codex / gemini / opencode, or none / shell to force a shell).
`created_at` is optional: the server stamps the current time when it is
omitted.

  # myteam.toml
  team_name   = "alpha"
  host_name   = "Neo"
  host_handle = "@@Neo"
  tab_group   = "alpha"

  [[members]]
  handle  = "@@Lead"
  command = "claude"
  is_lead = true

  [[members]]
  handle  = "@@Alice"
  command = "codex"

  # A custom launcher the command can't reveal: name the agent.
  [[members]]
  handle  = "@@Bob"
  command = "./my-agent.sh"
  env     = { CHAN_AGENT = "gemini" }

Write the team (config.toml + the server-regenerated bootstrap.md + the
tasks/journals/followups tree) inside the workspace at `alpha/`, then
spawn it:
  cs terminal team new alpha --config myteam.toml

Provision the team with the round's work at the same time. The brief is
folded verbatim into bootstrap.md, so every member reads it as part of
its process doc:
  cs terminal team new alpha --config myteam.toml --brief round.md

Preview the WHOLE bootstrap as a runnable shell script (mutates nothing;
prints to stdout). Run it from a chan terminal at the workspace root to
spawn the team:
  cs terminal team new alpha --config myteam.toml --script

Pipe the config in instead of a file:
  cat myteam.toml | cs terminal team new alpha --stdin

Bring a saved team back up (or emit its bootstrap script):
  cs terminal team load alpha
  cs terminal team load alpha --script

HOLD FOR A CHECK BEFORE ANY WORK STARTS:
Members start as soon as they are poked, so if you want to inspect the
roster first, say so IN THE BRIEF -- there is no flag for it. A brief
that opens with:

  Read this bootstrap end to end, reply with your handle, your role and
  the peer you report to, then HOLD. Do not start any work until you
  are poked with a task path.

gives you a window to read each tab, fix the roster, and only then poke
the lead to distribute.

A WORKFLOW THAT SCALES:
  1. Keep a scratch directory for the round, outside the material you
     want indexed and graphed.
  2. Drop a requirements document in it: what to build, what done looks
     like, what not to touch.
  3. Give ONE agent that document and have it produce a roadmap -- the
     ordered, dependency-aware breakdown, with an owner per item.
  4. Spawn a team with that roadmap as its --brief, sized to the
     parallel items (a lead plus 2-4 workers goes a long way).
  5. Stay in the loop through the lead, who surveys you for decisions
     and reports completions.
The split matters: planning is one careful agent's job, execution is
where more terminals actually buy you throughput.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  - `new` writes {dir}/config.toml (normalized, with created_at
    stamped when omitted), regenerates {dir}/bootstrap.md, and creates
    {dir}/tasks, {dir}/journals, {dir}/followups.
  - `new` and `load` then SPAWN: one terminal per member, lead first,
    each tab named after the member's handle, in the team's tab group
    (`tab_group`, else the team name; a live collision resolves to
    <group>-2, -3, ...). Sessions bind to the calling window and
    surface as tabs in it.
  - After a boot grace, each AGENT member is poked its identity prompt
    with that agent's submit chord, pointing it at bootstrap.md. Shell
    members are spawned but never poked.
  - `--script` mutates nothing and prints the script to stdout;
    otherwise the one-line spawn summary goes to stderr.

CAUTIONS:
  - `new` OVERWRITES {dir}/config.toml and regenerates bootstrap.md.
    bootstrap.md is tool-owned: hand edits are lost on the next write.
    Put your custom instructions in --brief instead.
  - Running `new` or `load` again spawns ANOTHER live copy of the team
    (in the next free group). Close the old one first with
    `cs terminal close --tab-group <group>`.
  - The call blocks through the boot grace so the identity pokes land
    before it returns.
  - A member whose command fails to start is reported and skipped; the
    rest of the team still comes up. Only a total failure is an error.

CAVEATS:
  - Workspace windows only, including `--script`. A standalone terminal
    refuses with a terminal-only message.
  - The dir must resolve inside the workspace: relative dirs join the
    caller's cwd, an absolute dir must be under the workspace root, and
    the workspace root itself is refused (name a subdirectory).
  - `--brief` is a `new` flag only: `load` never regenerates
    bootstrap.md, so there is nothing for a brief to fold into.
  - Exactly one member must be `is_lead`, and there must be 1..=9 of
    them; anything else is rejected before a single tab is spawned.

CAUTIONS:
  - Blocks through the boot grace before the pokes are delivered.
  - Overwrites an existing team at {dir}: config.toml is replaced and
    bootstrap.md is regenerated from the config plus `--brief`.
  - Passing both `--config` and `--stdin`, or neither, is an error.
  - `--mcp-env` defaults OFF (codex fails to start on a stray MCP
    descriptor); agents still reach `cs search` and friends with it off.
    Passing it overrides `mcp_env` in the input config.

CAVEATS:
  - Workspace windows only, including `--script`.
  - The config is rejected before anything is written or spawned unless
    it has 1..=9 members with exactly one `is_lead` and non-empty
    team_name / host_name / host_handle / member handles.
  - A member command matching no known agent spawns as a shell member:
    no submit chord, no identity poke.

/// `cs terminal write` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_TERMINAL_WRITE: &str = r#"Write raw bytes into live terminal session(s), queued per target and
delivered when that target is idle.

No newline is appended. `cs terminal write --tab-name @@A ls` only
types "ls" and leaves it at the prompt; `cs terminal write
--tab-name @@A $'ls\n'` runs it. --stdin reads the bytes from this
process's stdin to EOF instead of the positional argument (UTF-8
only). At least one of --tab-name / --tab-group is required.

The bytes are QUEUED, not written straight through. Each session
has its own FIFO, and the drainer delivers the next message only
once that session's output has gone quiet, then waits for the
agent's generation to start before the one after it. Chained writes
therefore submit one after another instead of stacking into a
single compose. The command prints its queue position and returns
at once; it never waits for the agent's reply.

--submit encodes the bytes so the named agent submits them
hands-free (trailing newlines are stripped first): claude appends a
chord, codex and opencode wrap the text in bracketed paste plus a
CR, gemini takes the CR as a separate later write. Omit it and the
text parks in the agent's compose box unsubmitted, since a bare
newline is a newline to an agent, not a submit.

/// `cs terminal write` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_TERMINAL_WRITE_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
  cs terminal write --tab-name @@Alice $'git status\n'
    runs it in @@Alice's shell; prints "queued at position 1"

  cs terminal write --tab-name @@Alice --submit claude \
    'rebase onto main, then report'
    claude receives the text AND submits it, hands-free

  cs terminal write --tab-name @@Alice 'draft: '
    parks "draft: " in the compose box, unsubmitted

  printf 'review %s\n' notes.md \
    | cs t w --tab-group alpha --stdin --submit codex
    one poke broadcast to every tab of group alpha

SIDE EFFECTS:
  Enqueues the bytes onto each matching session's write queue; the
  PTY sees them later, when the drainer fires. The ack ("queued at
  position N" for a single match, "queued to N terminal session(s)"
  for a fan-out) goes to stderr; stdout stays empty.

  --submit gemini sends the text and the bare CR as TWO writes, so
  two queue entries and two acks: gemini folds a Return that
  arrives with the text into Shift+Return.

CAUTIONS:
  Queue cap: 100 entries per target. A write to a full queue is
  dropped ("N at queue cap (dropped)"), and when every match is
  full the command fails with "matched session(s) at the 100-write
  queue cap; nothing queued". A restart respawns the session, so
  anything still queued for it is lost. No selector match is an
  error ("no live terminal session matched"), not a silent no-op.

CAVEATS:
  Idle is inferred from output quiescence, so a target parked at
  its prompt with a paused, half-typed buffer reads as idle and
  gets written into anyway. Selection spans the whole server, so a
  duplicated tab name is written to twice.

/// `cs upload` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_UPLOAD: &str = r#"Raise this window's file-upload UI, targeting a directory.

The same UI the Inspector's upload pill raises: a file picker opens in
the window, then the picked files stream in behind the shared
transfer-progress bubble. The files come off the machine VIEWING the
window, so a workspace served from a devserver receives files from
your laptop.

PATH is required and names the destination DIRECTORY: "." is the
terminal's current directory, and a file path targets its parent so an
upload always lands in a folder. In a workspace window the destination
is resolved workspace-relative and must stay inside the workspace root;
in a standalone terminal it is the absolute path the shell itself can
reach, and the transfer route pre-flights that the directory is
writable before writing anything.
"#;

/// `cs upload` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_UPLOAD_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
  cs upload .
    Opens the picker; picked files land in the current directory.
  cs upload notes/inbox
    Targets that folder instead.
  cs upload notes/plan.md
    Targets notes/ -- a file argument resolves to its parent.

SIDE EFFECTS:
  Queues ONE window command and returns; the picker and the transfer
  both happen in the window. The ack ("upload request queued for
  <dir>") goes to stderr. The uploaded bytes are written by the
  window's transfer, not by this process.

CAUTIONS:
  Fire-and-forget: exit 0 means the picker was raised, not that
  anything transferred. One upload at a time -- a second one reports
  "upload already in progress" in the window. Nothing is ever
  overwritten: an upload whose name already exists in the destination
  is refused.

CAVEATS:
  Works in workspace windows and standalone terminals, but with
  different roots: workspace-relative and walled at the workspace root
  in one, plain filesystem paths under the shell's own reach in the
  other. Picker cancels and transfer errors surface in the window's
  status bar, never on this terminal.

/// `cs window` long help (manpage head).
pub(crate) const CS_WINDOW: &str = r"Read the window registry and drive the desktop's OS windows.

DESCRIPTION:
`cs window list` (or `cs w l`) prints the library's authoritative
window set -- every window across every tenant, with its library,
kind, title, ordinal and status. The status is `connected` when a
live event socket is tagged with that window right now (including a
window chan-desktop has hidden with its close button), else
`offline`. `--json [--pretty]` emits the raw records.

The lifecycle verbs drive real windows. `new` opens one whose kind
is derived from the calling tenant: a standalone terminal spawns
another terminal window, a workspace spawns another window of that
workspace. `open <id>` focuses a window, un-hiding it if it was
hidden. `hide <id>` is the OS close-button behavior: terminals and
layout stay warm and reopenable. `rm <id>` destroys the window and
deletes its saved layout. Titles are library-owned and
auto-derived; there is no rename verb.

Session-scoped like `cs terminal list`: needs $CHAN_CONTROL_SOCKET
only, no window id.
";

/// `cs window` examples, side effects, and caveats.
pub(crate) const CS_WINDOW_AFTER: &str = r#"EXAMPLES:
  cs window list
    a | window | library | kind | title | # | status | table;
    status is connected or offline

  cs window new
    -> the new window id, printed on stdout

  cs window hide win-3
    -> "hid window win-3"; bring it back with
       `cs window open win-3`

  cs window rm win-3
    -> "removed window win-3", or "deleted saved layout for
       win-3 (no live window)" when nothing was live

SIDE EFFECTS:
  `new` spawns an OS window; `open` and `hide` change a window's
  visibility. `rm` drops the persisted registry row, reaps that
  window's terminal sessions and its saved layout, then closes any
  live native window. Each verb prints one line on stdout (`new`
  prints the id); failures go to stderr and exit non-zero.

CAUTIONS:
  `rm` is destructive and has no undo: the saved layout is gone, so
  the window cannot be reopened. Use `hide` when you want it back.
  `rm` of a window with live terminals is REFUSED -- "window <id>
  has N live terminal session(s); re-run with --force to remove
  them" -- so a removal never kills a running agent by surprise.
  `--force` removes it and those shells with it. The guard runs
  server-side, so it holds headless too.
  `rm` of an id with neither a window nor a saved layout errors:
  "no window or saved layout for <id>".

CAVEATS:
  `new`, `open` and `hide` need the chan desktop app; with no
  desktop attached they refuse with "window management requires the
  chan desktop app". `rm` still works headless, because the server
  (not the desktop) owns the registry row.
  A standalone `chan open` serve has no library window set, so
  `cs window list` is empty there.
  Subcommands infer (`cs w l`, `cs w n`, `cs w o`, `cs w r`), but
  `hide` needs at least `cs w hi`: a bare `h` is ambiguous with
  the auto-generated `help` subcommand.
