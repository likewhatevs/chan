//! Named process exit codes for the `cs` client, and the typed error that
//! carries one up to the dispatch edge.
//!
//! A bounded blocking request that gets no reply within its window exits
//! [`CONTROL_TIMEOUT`] (124): a `cs terminal survey` whose `--timeout`
//! elapsed, or a `cs copy` / `cs paste` whose clipboard round-trip got no
//! window reply. The server answers such a request with
//! `ControlResponse::Timeout`; [`crate::control::send_control_request`] turns
//! that into a [`ControlTimeout`], and the command's dispatch edge downcasts
//! it, prints the elapsed-window line, and exits with [`CONTROL_TIMEOUT`],
//! so a caller can tell "no answer in time" apart from a real error (exit 1)
//! and from a delivered reply (exit 0).
