// Optimistic BRIDGE for the mutating registry actions (workspace on/off, served
// devserver-workspace on/off, devserver connect/disconnect). The AUTHORITATIVE
// spinner state is the backend lifecycle `status` each row now carries
// (`starting` / `connecting`); this store only bridges the brief gap between a
// click and the first refetch that lands that status, so a click gives instant
// button feedback before the backend's transition arrives.
//
// A reactive map of markers keyed per item, each recording the desired
// end-state (`target`) + a start timestamp (`ts`). A marker lives only until the
// next reconcile sees the row's status move off its pre-click state (the backend
// has begun the transition, so `status` takes over) — or a short backstop
// elapses. It is in-memory only: a boot-restore re-mount reports `status:
// starting` straight from the backend, so the spinner appears with no persisted
// marker and no timer driving it.
