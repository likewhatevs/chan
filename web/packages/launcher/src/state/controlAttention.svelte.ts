// Devserver control terminals awaiting attention.

// When a connected devserver stops answering while its CONTROL terminal is still
// alive, the desktop emits `devserver-control-attention`. The launcher turns the
// devserver identity row's status dot RED (the same dot that shows green while
// connected) and slow-flashes the control row's eye. Both clear when the desktop
// reports the connection restored, or when the user acts on the control row.
//
// Keyed by the devserver's LIBRARY id (the id the control window record carries)
// so the feed matches the flashing row directly. Desktop events carry the
// devserver id, resolved to its library id at mark time.
