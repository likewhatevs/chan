// This is the single source of truth for the graph's physics. The
// production renderer (components/GraphCanvas.svelte) imports
// `DEFAULT_FORCE` as the default for its optional `force` prop, and the
// standalone graph-tuner playground (src/graph-tuner/) drives the same
// shape live via sliders. Dial values in here once and BOTH the live
// graph and the tuner pick them up. Tune in the playground, then paste
// the winning numbers back into `DEFAULT_FORCE`.
//
// `hierarchyYSpacing` + `hierarchyYStrength` drive the filesystem-spine
// forceY, and `parentXStrength` drives the parent-anchored forceX, so
// each file node sits above its directory and siblings cluster
// horizontally under the same parent.
