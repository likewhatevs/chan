// mention, resolved or not. GraphPanel's inspector wiring rendered the
// button only when the mention resolved to a contact note (it scoped to
// `contact:<path>`); an unresolved mention left `onSetAsScope` undefined
// so the button vanished. The host now falls back to the mention lens
// (`mention:@@Name`) via `openGraphForMention`. The mention lens itself
// (bidirectional BFS) is pinned separately in
// graphMentionLensBidirectionalBfs.test.ts and does not move here.
