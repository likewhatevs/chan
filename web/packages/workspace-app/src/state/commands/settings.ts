// The settings command opens the configuration surface. It calls its action
// directly from the launcher; the default and assigned chords route through
// App.svelte so host dispatch and keyboard dispatch share the same command id.
// Machine-global config stays available in every window, including standalone
// terminals. See state/commands.ts for the Command shape and helpers.
