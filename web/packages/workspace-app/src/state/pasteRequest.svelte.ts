// The `cs paste` reply flow + the chan-owned paste card.
//
// A `clipboard_read` window command starts an immediate clipboard read. In a
// plain browser that read can PEND on the browser's paste-permission UI
// (WebKit's floating Paste button, a Firefox prompt) with nothing in the
// window saying why the CLI is blocked. So the read races a short threshold:
// settle fast (native desktop IPC, an already-granted browser) and the reply
// POSTs with no UI at all; still pending at the threshold and a corner card
// (PasteRequestBubble, the SessionHandoverBubble shell) explains what is
// waiting, with a [Paste] button whose click carries the user activation a
// browser read wants, and a [Cancel] that answers the CLI immediately.
//
// The window bus completes once per request id, so whichever reply lands
// first wins and every later one 404s harmlessly (the original pending read
// resolving after the card's Paste, a stale card's Cancel). Nothing here is
// persisted: a reload leaves the CLI to the server's 30s timeout.
