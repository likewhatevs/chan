// The command catalog: every launcher-invokable action as data. Each
// entry pairs a stable id with a title, a category for grouping, an
// availability predicate, and a run() thunk. Chorded commands reuse
// their SHORTCUTS id so the launcher can show the current chord via
// chordFor(id) and route run() back through the same dispatch the chord
// fires; chordless commands live only here and call their action
// directly. Categories match the groups the launcher renders.
//
// Entries register through registerCommands from per-category modules in
// state/commands/, each imported for its side effect by
// state/commands/install. Keeping one module per surface lets the
// command lanes own disjoint files; the launcher reads the merged,
// context-filtered list. This catalog is also the single command source
// the launcher and command-forwarding surfaces consume.
