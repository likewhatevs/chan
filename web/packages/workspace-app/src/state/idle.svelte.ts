// Window-level idle tracker. After IDLE_MS without a "user is doing
// something" event, `idle.active` flips to true and the floating pills
// (BottomPill, the editor's top formatting bar) fade out so they
// don't sit on top of content while the user is reading.
// Any of the watched events flips it back to false and restarts the
// timer.
//
// Reset triggers: mousedown, click, touchstart, plus a
// `selectionchange` listener that only fires when a real, non-empty
// text selection lands (used by the search action). Keyboard input
// (`keydown`) is NOT a reset trigger: typing or arrow-key caret
// motion should leave the floating pills hidden. Mouse motion / wheel /
// scroll are NOT reset triggers either: cursor-following scroll while the user types
// would otherwise pop the pill back on every line wrap, and ambient
// mouse twitches over the writing surface are not real intent. The
// pill stays hidden until the user clicks or selects text.
//
// Boot behavior: idle.active starts false, so the pill is visible
// when the app loads / a new tab opens; the very first arm() starts
// the fade timer, so if the user never interacts the pill fades on
// its own after IDLE_MS.
//
// Pin mechanism: while any consumer holds a pin (typically because the
// mouse is hovering over an accessory bar), `idle.active` stays false
// and the timer is suspended. Each bar's mouseenter / mouseleave calls
// pinAccessory() and the returned release fn so the pill doesn't fade
// from under the user's cursor.
