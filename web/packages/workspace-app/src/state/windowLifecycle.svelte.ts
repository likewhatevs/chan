// The session leader can discard or hide a follower's window from the launcher.
// The server pushes a targeted window_command (window_discarded / window_hidden)
// to the affected window's /ws socket; store.svelte.ts routes it here. The SPA
// then shows a terminal SessionEndedOverlay so a torn-down window does not sit
// as a stale, silently-dead view. A native desktop window is reconciled away by
// the watcher instead and never reaches this path.
