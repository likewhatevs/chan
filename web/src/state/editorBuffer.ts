/// Editor hang-recovery via localStorage.
///
/// Persists unsaved editor content so a forced reload (the SPA hangs
/// and the user closes-and-reopens the window) doesn't lose unsaved
/// data. The mechanism:
///
///   * On every editor mutation (debounced ~500ms),
///     `queueBufferWrite(key, content, path)` stores
///     `{ content, updatedAt, path, sessionId }` under
///     `chan:editor-buffer:<key>`.
///   * On editor mount, `divergentBufferOrNull` compares any stored
///     buffer to the on-disk content and surfaces a restore banner
///     only when the buffer represents recoverable work.
///   * On save / clean transition / discard, `clearEditorBuffer(key)`
///     removes the entry.
///   * On app load, `pruneEditorBuffers()` evicts entries past the TTL
///     and total-size cap.
///
/// Buffers are keyed on the workspace root plus the file's workspace-
/// relative path, not the in-memory tab id: tab ids are regenerated on
/// every page load, so a path key is what survives the reload the
/// recovery exists for, and the root scopes it so two workspaces with a
/// same-relative-path file (e.g. README.md) do not share one buffer.
///
/// Restore eligibility turns on `sessionId`. Each page load gets a
/// fresh SESSION_ID; a buffer carries the id of the load that wrote
/// it. The user's own live edits remount the tab without reloading the
/// page, so their buffer always matches the current SESSION_ID and is
/// treated as live (no banner). Only a buffer left by a DIFFERENT load
/// (the crash-then-reload case) is offered for restore.
///
/// localStorage SSR-safety: every entry point gates on
/// `typeof localStorage !== "undefined"` so unit tests (vitest node
/// env) and SSR builds don't blow up; they return null / no-op when
/// storage is unavailable.
///
/// Two tabs open against the same path share a buffer key. That is
/// acceptable: same file, same unsaved-content semantic, and whoever
/// mounts first reads the banner.
