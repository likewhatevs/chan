// Scope helpers for the Graph overlay. `ScopeOption` is the
// discriminated union the graph uses to describe "what part of my
// world am I looking at": a file, directory, git repo, group of
// visible files, tag, contact, language, the whole workspace, or
// global cross-workspace scope.
//
// Each graph tab stores the chosen scope as a `scopeId` string
// (`file:<path>`, `dir:<path>`, `tag:<id>`, `language:<lang>`, ...);
// GraphPanel's `synthesizeScope` turns that id back into a typed
// ScopeOption and `graphTitle` renders it. `defaultScopeId` picks the
// id matching what is in front of the user; `scopeKey` / `parentDir` /
// `visibleFilePaths` are small path helpers used by the graph open
// paths.
//
// The Search overlay no longer has a scope picker (search is
// workspace-wide), so the dropdown-options builder that used to live
// here was removed with it.

// which Vite resolves cleanly.
