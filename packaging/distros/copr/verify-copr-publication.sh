# Confirm a COPR webhook build actually published, at the released version.
#
# The `copr` job in publish-downstream.yml POSTs a custom webhook and, until
# now, trusted the 200 on enqueue as the whole story. That proves the webhook
# was accepted, not that a build ran, not that any chroot succeeded, and not
# that the built version is the released tag: the SCM packages carry an empty
# committish and rebuild main's HEAD, so a push between the tag and COPR
# dequeuing produces a package labelled X.Y.Z whose contents are not X.Y.Z.
#
# This probe reads the unauthenticated COPR API (no secret) for the build the
# webhook created and ends nonzero unless every chroot succeeded at the
# released version. Four outcomes, following the PPA dry-run precedent:
#
#   - every chroot succeeded at the expected version           -> green
#   - a chroot failed or was cancelled                         -> red (named)
#   - the built version is not the released tag                -> red (freeze)
#   - the budget expired with the build unfinished/absent      -> red, worded
#     as publication UNCONFIRMED rather than failed
#   - COPR_WEBHOOK absent on the canonical repository          -> red
#     (a green no-op on forks)
#
# The budget exceeds the observed worst-case COPR build so expiry is a real
# anomaly. From the recorded build ids in
# team/roadmap/done/packaging-aarch64-validation.md, harvested via this same
# API, the worst submitted->ended total across v0.67.0-v0.73.0 is chan-desktop
# 0.68.0 at 3237s (~54 min; worst build phase 3060s, worst queue 466s). The
# default budget is 5400s (90 min), ~1.67x that worst total, leaving ~36 min of
# headroom over the worst build, which is ~4.6x the worst observed queue.
#
# It reports the chroot set it observed but does not assert it: the enabled
# chroots and the EL9 desktop denylist are console-only state, so the human
# check in the release skill stays.
#
# Env:
#   PACKAGE            required, chan|chan-desktop
#   RELEASE_TAG        required, e.g. v0.74.0 (the provenance target)
#   WEBHOOK_PRESENT    1 when the webhook was POSTed, 0/empty when absent
#   CANONICAL          "true" on fiorix/chan; controls the webhook-absent verdict
#   POSTED_AT          epoch seconds of the webhook POST; builds at/after it are
#                      candidates. Defaults to 0 (any build) when unset.
#   COPR_OWNER         default fiorix
#   COPR_PROJECT       default chan
#   COPR_API_BASE      default https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/api_3
