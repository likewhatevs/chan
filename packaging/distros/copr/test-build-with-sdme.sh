# Check build-with-sdme.sh's host-side control flow against a stub sdme.
#
# The real matrix needs imported CentOS rootfs images and hours of offline RPM
# rebuilds, so the parts that are easy to get wrong and expensive to reach
# (per-target status capture, the guest wrapper reaching its result handback,
# a re-run after a failed target, an unusable result directory, interrupt
# handling, knob and preflight validation) are exercised here. A stub sdme
# reproduces the two container behaviours the driver is built around,
# confirmed by a live sdme probe on 2026-07-19:
#
#   - `sdme new` propagates the guest exit status and deletes the container
#     when it is non-zero, while the writable host bind survives.
#   - `-- /usr/bin/env VAR=... /bin/bash -c '<multiline>'` delivers the script
#     as one argv element.
#
# The driver under test is symlinked into a throwaway repo skeleton, so it is
# the real file; only its guest side and sdme are stubs.
#
# What this cannot cover: the stub guest runs as the host user, so every file
# it writes is host-owned before the wrapper runs and no assertion here can see
# a uid change. A chown shim on the guest's PATH records the handback instead,
# which gates the wrapper reaching it on the failing path as well as the
# passing one. That the chown crosses uids for real is a property of a root
# guest against a host bind, and only a real container run shows it.
