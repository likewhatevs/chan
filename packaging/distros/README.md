# distros

Source packaging for Fedora COPR, Ubuntu Launchpad (PPA), and the Arch User Repository: standalone `chan` and `chan-desktop`. COPR and Launchpad build from a vendored source tarball because their builders are offline; AUR users build from the tagged source with locked npm and Cargo dependencies. The public command surface is the root Makefile (`make distros-tarball`, `make copr-srpm`, `make copr-build`, `make copr-check`, `make ppa-source`, `make ppa-upload`, `make aur-check`).

| Path | Concern |
|---|---|
| `mkdist` | Vendored source tarball builder shared by both ecosystems: git archive + prebuilt web bundles + `cargo vendor` + in-tarball `.cargo/config.toml` offline redirect. |
| `shared/` | `chan-devserver.service` (systemd user unit) and `chan-desktop.desktop`, installed by both the rpm and deb packages. |
| `fedora/` | `chan.spec`, `chan-desktop.spec`. The build tooling rewrites `%upstream_version` from the workspace Cargo.toml, so the committed value is a fallback. |
| `copr/` | `make-srpm.sh` (tarball + spec sync + `rpmbuild -bs`; runs in the COPR SRPM chroot or a local Fedora container), `build-srpm.sh` (local container driver, `--submit` for copr-cli), `build-with-sdme.sh` (host driver for the CentOS matrix behind `make copr-check`), `build-in-container.sh` (the per-container rebuild, install, and smoke it runs in the guest), and `test-build-with-sdme.sh` (host-side control-flow check for the driver, against a stub sdme). |
| `debian/` | `chan/` + `chan-desktop/` debian source dirs, `build-source.sh` (per-series `debuild -S`), `upload.sh` (dput). |
| `arch/` | Versionless AUR templates, renderer, and the shared clean-container/sdme validation path. |

`.copr/Makefile` at the repo root is COPR's "make srpm" entry point and delegates to `copr/make-srpm.sh`.

## Package shape

- `chan`: `/usr/bin/chan` + `/usr/bin/cs` symlink (argv0 dispatch) + the devserver user unit. Runtime deps: glibc and systemd (the unit and `chan devserver --service=systemd`); everything native is statically linked (ring, bundled SQLite, zstd; rustls, no OpenSSL).
- `chan-desktop`: `/usr/bin/chan-desktop` + `chan`/`cs` symlinks to it (the desktop binary IS the CLI via argv0 dispatch), `.desktop` entry with the `chan://` scheme handler, hicolor icons, and the same devserver unit. It conflicts with and provides `chan`; RPM/deb retain their existing replacement metadata, while AUR deliberately does not replace an installed package. Runtime deps add the WebKitGTK 4.1/GTK3/libsoup3 stack (auto-derived from sonames).
- All distro source builds export `CHAN_PACKAGED=rpm|deb|aur`, and the local `make linux-archpkg` QA package exports `pacman`. The marker bakes the self-update surface off (`crates/chan/src/update.rs`): the probe/banner stay silent and `chan upgrade` points at the package manager. The desktop app still writes its self-healing `~/.local/bin/{chan,cs}` shims on boot; they point at the packaged binary and coexist with the `/usr/bin` symlinks.
- The `.deb`/`.rpm` release assets built by `make linux-deb`/`make linux-rpm` carry no marker, by design. No repository serves them: they are downloaded and installed by hand, so `sudo apt upgrade` would never update them and `chan upgrade` is the correct update path. The marker belongs only where a package manager genuinely owns updates.
- The packaged user unit lives in `/usr/lib/systemd/user/`; a unit written by `chan devserver --service=systemd` into `~/.config/systemd/user/` overrides it per the systemd user search order, so both flows coexist.

## Service configuration

COPR (`https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org`, project `fiorix/chan`, ID 245281):

- Chroots: the latest stable Fedora + rawhide on x86_64/aarch64; `centos-stream+epel-next-9` on x86_64/aarch64 for `chan`; and `centos-stream-10` on x86_64/aarch64 for both packages.
- Two SCM packages, `chan` and `chan-desktop`: Git source pointed at the GitHub repo, build method "make srpm", Spec File `packaging/distros/fedora/<pkg>.spec` (COPR forwards it as `spec=` to `.copr/Makefile`), committish empty (builds main's HEAD).
- CentOS chroot additional repository: `https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/$releasever/Everything/$basearch/`. Add it separately to each of the four CentOS chroots, not project-wide, and keep `$releasever` literal so the EL9 and EL10 chroots select matching EPEL content without exposing Fedora chroots to nonexistent EPEL release paths.
- `chan-desktop` denies `centos-stream+epel-next-9-*`: EPEL Next 9 does not carry the WebKitGTK 4.1/libsoup3 development stack required by the current Tauri build. `chan` is enabled in all four CentOS chroots.
- The `publish-downstream` workflow (below) POSTs the project's **custom** webhook (Settings > Integrations, `webhooks/custom/<id>/<token>/<pkg>/`) for both packages; the base URL lives in the `COPR_WEBHOOK` repo secret. COPR's GitHub integration stays disabled: it fires on every push, not just releases.
- Local iteration without a release: run `make copr-check` for clean CentOS rebuild/install smokes, `make copr-srpm` for SRPM-only work, `make copr-build` for a raw submission, or curl the custom webhook manually. Raw `chan-desktop` submissions exclude both EL9 chroots just like the SCM package denylist.
- If a stable chroot's rust trails the workspace MSRV, enable an external rust repo for that chroot in the project settings, or wait for the distro update; rawhide tracks upstream closely.

The roadmap calls this Hyperscale support because that is the deployment target. Hyperscale is not a COPR buildroot input: the EL9 RPM is built against CentOS Stream 9 plus EPEL/EPEL Next and remains installable on a Hyperscale-enabled host.

**Repo-controlled vs COPR console state.** Two separate things decide what COPR builds, and only one of them is in this repo:

- **Repo-controlled**, readable and verifiable from a checkout: the spec files, what `make-srpm.sh` produces, and the two `--exclude-chroot centos-stream+epel-next-9-*` arguments that `build-srpm.sh --submit` passes for a raw `chan-desktop` submission.
- **COPR console state**, which no artifact here asserts or verifies: the enabled chroot list, the per-chroot additional EPEL repository, and the `chan-desktop` package chroot denylist.

The release path never touches `build-srpm.sh`: `publish-downstream` POSTs the custom webhook, COPR rebuilds the SCM package from Git, and the console denylist alone keeps the two unsupported EL9 `chan-desktop` jobs from being scheduled. COPR's public package endpoint does not expose the denylist, so it cannot be checked from a script either. Confirm it by eye in the project settings (Packages > `chan-desktop` > Edit) and by the absence of EL9 desktop jobs in the first build after any package or chroot change.

**Local matrix (`make copr-check`).** Import native-architecture rootfs images once, then point the Make target at their sdme names:

```sh
sudo sdme fs import centos-stream-9 quay.io/centos/centos:stream9 --install-packages=yes -v
sudo sdme fs import centos-stream-10 quay.io/centos/centos:stream10 --install-packages=yes -v
make copr-check DOCKER='sudo docker'
```

`copr-check` requires a Linux host. The guest hands its results back through a writable host bind, and on macOS lima mounts the host home read-only over virtiofs, which is why `packaging/sdme/build-chan-desktop.sh` stages its artifacts in the VM and pulls them out with `limactl copy` instead. `SDME` defaults to `sudo sdme`.

`COPR_RELEASE=9|10` and `PKG=chan|chan-desktop` narrow a diagnostic run. EL9 desktop is intentionally rejected. Imported rootfs names are per host: `COPR_EL9_ROOTFS` and `COPR_EL10_ROOTFS` default to the names above, and a missing one lists the names the host actually has. `DOCKER` defaults to `docker`; use `sudo docker` on hosts with a root-only socket. `REUSE_SRPM=1` reuses existing SRPMs for a guest-only diagnostic retry. `KEEP_CONTAINER=1` keeps every container for diagnosis, including a failed target's; otherwise each container is removed as its target finishes. Both take `0` or `1` and reject any other value. Every target runs even after an earlier one fails, and the run ends with a per-target PASS/FAIL summary and a non-zero exit if any target failed; an interrupt aborts the matrix instead. Results land under `target/distros/copr-check/el<9|10>/<arch>/<package>/`.

`sdme new` deletes the container when its guest command exits non-zero, so a failed target's results directory, not its container, is the surviving diagnostic surface. The guest wrapper hands that directory back to the host user on every path it reaches, the failing one included, which is what lets the next run clear it. A killed or timed-out container never reaches the handback; that leaves root-owned 0644 files in a host-owned directory, which the host can still read and delete. A directory an older run left owned by a container uid fails its own target with the `sudo rm -rf` that clears it, and the rest of the matrix still runs.

`test-build-with-sdme.sh` runs the driver against a stub sdme and a stub guest in about three seconds: per-target status capture, the re-run after a failed target, an unusable results directory, interrupt handling, and knob and preflight validation. Its stub guest runs as the host user, so it gates the wrapper reaching the handback, not the uid change itself; only a real container run shows that. Run it after editing the driver, since the real matrix costs hours of offline RPM rebuilds.

This is a repository-fidelity and packaging check, not a mock buildroot: `dnf builddep` installs the declared `BuildRequires` into a full CentOS rootfs, so a dependency the rootfs already provides but the spec omits passes here and fails in COPR's minimal buildroot.

Launchpad (`ppa:fiorix/chan`, processors amd64 + arm64 -- Launchpad defaults to amd64 only; the checkbox is in the PPA's "Change details"):

- The upload signing key is registered with the Launchpad account and lives in the repo secrets for CI (below); locally debsign uses `DEBSIGN_KEY` (or its default key). Local signing needs a tty pinentry: prime gpg-agent from a real terminal first (any one-off `gpg --clearsign`) when driving the build from an agent shell, or `debsign` the staged `*_source.changes` manually.
- Host prerequisites for local build/sign/upload: `devscripts`, `debhelper`, `dpkg-dev`, `dput` (`debuild -S` runs `debian/rules clean`, which needs debhelper's `dh`).
- Local flow (re-uploads, pre-release testing): `make distros-tarball && make ppa-source PPA_SERIES="noble resolute"` then `make ppa-upload`. Source-only uploads; each series gets `X.Y.Z-1~<series>1` while the orig tarball stays byte-identical across series (Launchpad requires this for one upstream version). A packaging-only re-upload bumps `SERIESREV`, which switches debuild to `-sd` (Launchpad already has the orig).
- Default PPA quota is ~2 GiB; each upstream version stores the ~63 MB orig twice (one per source package). Delete superseded versions or request a quota bump as needed.

## Release automation

`.github/workflows/publish-downstream.yml` runs after a successful tagged Release workflow and carries Docker Hub, COPR, the PPA, and the AUR. It is deliberately separate from `release.yml`: secondary failures are red and attributable in this workflow but cannot fail the GitHub Release, `/dl` metadata, or Pages. Each target has an independent job chain, so one secondary failure does not suppress the others. Distro jobs filter prerelease versions; Docker preserves immutable prerelease tags but moves `latest` only for GA. Publication steps no-op when their secret is absent:

- `docker-build` builds both native architectures and pushes by digest; `docker-manifest` assembles and verifies the same four multi-arch images documented under [`../docker/`](../docker/). A `publish=false` dispatch builds cache-only and intentionally skips Docker Hub config and login.
- `copr` curls the custom webhook for both packages. Verify `chan` across Fedora plus all four CentOS chroots, and `chan-desktop` across Fedora plus Stream 10. The console denylist should prevent EL9 desktop jobs, but it lapsed for v0.72.0; if one is scheduled, the spec now refuses EL9 immediately and names the unavailable dependencies. Check the job count on every release because the denylist remains console-only state.
- `launchpad` rebuilds the vendored tarball at the released commit, imports `LAUNCHPAD_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`/`LAUNCHPAD_GPG_PASSPHRASE` into an ephemeral loopback-pinentry keyring, and runs the same build-source.sh + upload.sh as the local flow.
- `aur-auth` proves the `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` credential against `aur.archlinux.org` before anything is pushed. `aur-validate` builds, installs, and smokes both source recipes on clean upstream Arch x86_64 containers and gates publication. `aur-validate-arm` runs the same path on native Arch Linux ARM aarch64 at GA but is observed rather than gating for v0.73.0; it uploads no artifact. This is its first end-to-end run, while v0.73.0 is also the first release that can reach the AUR after v0.72.0 did not publish. Once ARM passes, v0.74.0 adds it to the publication gate. See [`arch/README.md`](arch/README.md).

Retry with `workflow_dispatch` and the tag. `targets` scopes the run to `docker`, `copr`, `launchpad`, or `aur`, so retrying a transient Launchpad ftp 550 does not also rebuild Docker or the Arch packages. `publish` defaults to false: a dispatch builds or renders without uploading unless it is set to true. Set `aur_validate_arm=true` when a manual AUR run should also collect native ARM evidence; it does not affect whether `aur-publish` runs in v0.73.0. Dry-run reports name only what they observed: Docker proves its cache-only builds without reading registry credentials, while the PPA and AUR jobs fail on the canonical repository when a credential they exist to prove is absent. On a fork, absent publication secrets are the expected no-op.

## Toolchain note

The workspace MSRV (`rust-toolchain.toml`) can run ahead of the distro archives. Fedora ships current rust in stable releases; Ubuntu ships versioned `rustc-1.XX`/`cargo-1.XX` packages that trail by a release or two, so `debian/*/rules` prefers the versioned toolchain when present and passes `--ignore-rust-version` to tolerate the gap. When `rustc-1.95` (or newer) reaches the target series, drop the flag and tighten the `Build-Depends` alternation in `debian/*/control`.
