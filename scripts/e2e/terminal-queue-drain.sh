# Live validation for chronological `cs terminal write` batching. Run from a
# chan terminal whose CHAN_CONTROL_SOCKET targets the server build under test.
# That server must serve a workspace the agent under test already trusts:
# codex and claude both park on a first-run trust prompt in an unfamiliar
# directory and never print their ready pattern, so a probe over a fresh
# random path fails every run on the ready-pattern timeout instead.
# Diagnostics go to stderr; one result row per run goes to stdout.
#
# Every run gets its OWN tab inside one probe group, so every scrollback read
# below is scoped to the run that made it. The group is closed on exit,
# including on failure.
#
# Two kinds of oracle appear below, and only one of them can fail a run:
#
#   LOAD-BEARING  The polled queue depth (`cs terminal list --json`, server
#                 state, not the screen) and the agent's own OUTPUT. The agent
#                 BUILDS each sentinel out of what it received
#                 (`QUEUE_DRAIN_BATCH_<blocks>` from the number of notification
#                 blocks it counted), so no literal in its input can satisfy
#                 one and an echo cannot fake a batch.
#   ADVISORY      Anything read out of the scrollback ring. That ring holds PTY
#                 OUTPUT only, so a framed envelope shows up there only if the
#                 agent renders the pasted body verbatim -- Claude prints
#                 `[Pasted text #1 +16 lines]` instead at these payload sizes.
#                 Advisory observations are recorded in the result row and
#                 never fail a run.
#
# What each case proves:
#
#   batch       Five notifications enqueued while the agent is provably
#               generating drain as ONE turn. Depth is 5 with nothing reaching
#               the busy compose box, then reaches 0 without the poller ever
#               seeing an intermediate 1..4, and the agent answers ONCE for all
#               five: it emits `QUEUE_DRAIN_BATCH_5` followed by the five tail
#               tokens in order, and never a `QUEUE_DRAIN_BATCH_0..4` (which is
#               what a per-message drain would produce).
#   boundaries  A no-submit write and an override-backed write each END the
#               batch prefix. Five messages whose every neighbour is a boundary
#               must drain ONE AT A TIME, so the poller has to observe EVERY
#               intermediate depth 4, 3, 2 and 1, the agent must never emit a
#               `QUEUE_DRAIN_BATCH_2..5`, and the tail tokens still arrive in
#               FIFO order, so nothing was skipped to batch a later message.
#   late        A sixth notification enqueued once the batch has drained gets
#               its OWN turn: the agent emits the batch sentinel and then a
#               separate `QUEUE_DRAIN_LATE_<token>` it builds from that
#               message alone, which proves the queue keeps draining after a
#               batch delivery.
#
# NOT covered here:
#
#   The enqueue-after-selection race. Required Behavior item 4 (a message
#   enqueued after the prefix is SELECTED waits for the next turn) is not
#   reachable from outside the server: selection and pop happen under one
#   queue lock inside a drainer tick, so an external enqueue lands either
#   before selection, where joining the batch is correct, or after the pop,
#   where a shell cannot tell the two apart. It is pinned by
#   `enqueue_after_atomic_batch_selection_stays_for_the_next_turn` in
#   crates/chan-library/src/terminal_sessions.rs, which drives the selector
#   directly.
#
#   The Rich Prompt boundary. Rich Prompt enters the queue over the terminal
#   WebSocket, which `cs` does not speak, so no shell harness can place one
#   between notifications. That boundary is pinned by the chan-library and
#   chan-server unit tests and by a browser smoke.

Environment:
  CS_BIN                      cs-compatible binary (default: cs). A development
                              chan binary must be invoked through a symlink
                              named cs so it enters that command surface.
  CHAN_TERMINAL_INPUT_GAP_MS  The SERVER's multi-part input gap. --gap
                              only asserts this matches; the value is read once
                              per server process, so sweeping it means
                              restarting the server under test with the new
                              value exported. The server IGNORES a value
                              outside 1..799 ms and runs its built-in 50 ms, so
                              --gap takes the same range and the env value is
                              put through the same clamp before it is compared.
  CHAN_GEMINI_ATOMIC_PROBE    Must be 1 for --case gap. It acknowledges that
                              the server is a scratch candidate where built-in
                              Gemini bypasses message_parts' Body/Chord split
                              and drains as one atomic InputSequence. The final
                              boundary build deliberately does not do this.

Payloads above the batch ceiling are advisory and require a scratch build with
a temporarily raised selector ceiling; pass --max-batch-bytes to match it.
