# Long pagination corpus

This document is deliberately long and non-repeating: every sentence has a unique marker, so any ink that appears on two pages is an engine bug, not repeated copy. It mixes prose, lists, tables, quotes, tall code blocks, a diagram, and an image across many page boundaries.
