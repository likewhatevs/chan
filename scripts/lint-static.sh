# lint-static.sh -- shellcheck over the repo's tracked shell scripts, and

# inside workflow `run:` blocks is linted by the same rules as a .sh file).
#
# Neither tool is a build dependency of chan, and neither is installable
# without root on every machine that runs the gate, so both are fetched at a
# pinned version into a user cache. Acquisition failure is fatal: a linter
# that silently skips when its tool is missing gates nothing.
#
# The severity and the exclude list live in .shellcheckrc at the repo root
# rather than here, so an editor integration reports what the gate enforces.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/lint-static.sh              # both passes
#   scripts/lint-static.sh shell        # shellcheck only
#   scripts/lint-static.sh workflows    # actionlint only

# there would mean a fresh download per gate. Here one download serves every
# worktree on the machine, and only a cold cache needs network.
