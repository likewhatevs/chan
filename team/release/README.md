# Release history

The development history of chan, one consolidated report per release era. Each `release-{NN}-{version}.md` is that era's front door: its roadmap (the asks), how the rounds and waves were structured, who worked it and how they coordinated, what shipped, and a retrospective with the lessons worth carrying forward. The `NN` prefix orders the reports chronologically; the version marks the release(s) the era shipped (`prerelease`/`unreleased` where no tag was cut). Going-forward reports drop the `NN` prefix and are named for their release (`release-v{version}.md`); a release cut through release candidates keeps its per-cycle rc reports (`release-v{version}-rc{N}.md`) as indented sub-entries under that release.

These reports are the project's second brain. The raw per-author journals and coordination buses that backed them were distilled into these files; the raw material is preserved in git history.

New agents should also read [`.agents/playbook.md`](../../.agents/playbook.md), the operational lessons distilled across the project.

  - [release-v0.66.1-rc2](release-v0.66.1-rc2.md) - rc2 folding in the rc1 smoke findings: the post-connect control-terminal rule, a per-tab survey FIFO, and small fixes and UX additions.

- [release-v0.70.0](release-v0.70.0.md) - first-class gateways in chan-desktop: add by URL, one account sign-in, live rosters under Computers, launcher notification bubbles, and the terminal-socket heartbeat/reconnect that keeps gateway terminals alive after idle.
- [release-v0.70.1](release-v0.70.1.md) - tunneled-devserver hardening: uploads and PDF export through the proxy, closed windows staying closed, OS logos and real names on rows, the port 8787 collision fix, and gateway rename.
- [release-v0.70.2](release-v0.70.2.md) - the terminal-reconnect regression patch (the control terminal no longer loops its connect script, an idle remote terminal keeps its process and stops leaking mouse tracking) plus table-cell inline markdown, exported-Excalidraw sizing, the slide-deck zoom_factor seed, and the page-width scrollbar position.
- [release-v0.70.3](release-v0.70.3.md) - the v0.70.2 regression patch: the editor's text-selection highlight restored under the default page-width cap, and a refused launcher Open turned into a dismissable pill instead of one stuck on the workspace forever.
- [release-v0.71.0](release-v0.71.0.md) - OpenCode as a first-class terminal agent, authenticated exact-origin desktop trust replacing the static wildcard grant, workspace search and graph traversal unified behind one bounded contract and one agent tool, `chan upgrade --version` resolving the last five GA releases, and two editor cosmetics; the first release cut through the team/roadmap + team/release structure.

## Conventions

Agent references in prose use plain names for people and lanes; the `@@` sigil is reserved for the five reusable skill identities (`@@architect`, `@@fabler`, `@@rustacean`, `@@syseng`, `@@webdev`) plus the generic `@@agent` for an unidentifiable past skill. A historical lane named for a discipline (Architect, Syseng, Rustacean, Web/Frontend) is rendered as its skill sigil (`@@architect`, `@@syseng`, `@@rustacean`, `@@webdev`) even where it sits among plain lane names; reused or suffixed slots (FrontendB, WebMain, FullStackA) stay plain. The coordination scheme evolved over the project; each report records the scheme that era ran on, and the cross-project summary is in [`.agents/playbook.md`](../../.agents/playbook.md). Reports are text only; a load-bearing screenshot is described in prose rather than embedded.
