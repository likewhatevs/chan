# Updater Signing Runbook

The updater key is separate from Apple Developer ID signing and
notarization. Apple signing controls whether macOS trusts the app
bundle. The updater minisign key controls whether an installed Chan
app accepts a downloaded update payload.

Two updater keypairs have existed: an early DEV key, and the
production key whose pubkey is embedded in
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` under `plugins.updater.pubkey` (rotated
in commit `3c1435b`; a one-time bridge release signed with the old
key carried existing installs across). Every updater payload is
signed with the production key.

## Key And Secret Rules

Private key values and passwords must not be printed, committed, or
pasted into logs.

Public key material is not secret. To inspect the currently embedded
updater pubkey without printing the full key:

```sh
cd desktop
node -e 'const c=require("./src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"); const crypto=require("crypto"); const k=c.plugins.updater.pubkey; console.log(`updater pubkey length=${k.length} sha256=${crypto.createHash("sha256").update(k).digest("hex")}`)'
```

To confirm local key files by presence only:

```sh
test -f ~/.tauri/chan-desktop.key && echo old-dev-key-file-present
test -f ~/.tauri/chan-desktop-prod.key && echo prod-key-file-present
test -f ~/.tauri/chan-desktop-prod.key.pub && echo prod-pubkey-file-present
```

## Signing An Updater Payload

```sh
cd desktop/src-tauri
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="$HOME/.tauri/chan-desktop-prod.key" \
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="$TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD" \
cargo tauri signer sign <UPDATE_PAYLOAD_FILE>
```

CI may use key contents instead of a filesystem path:

```sh
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="<secret key contents>" \
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="<secret password or empty>" \
cargo tauri signer sign <UPDATE_PAYLOAD_FILE>
```

For a no-password key, set the password variable to an explicit empty
string; the Tauri signer can otherwise prompt or fail in
non-interactive runs. Only the env var names belong in docs and
workflow comments. Values belong in the release owner's local secret
store or CI secrets.

macOS packaging and notarization also need the Apple signing variables
documented in `.agents/desktop.md`, but those are not updater signature keys.

## Identifying Which Key Signed A Payload

Given an updater payload and its signature, verify against each
public key. The key that verifies the signature is the signing key.

The production public key is the current
`plugins.updater.pubkey` value in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

The old DEV public key is the value from the parent of the production
pubkey rotation commit:

```sh
git show 3c1435b^:desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json \
  | node -e 'let s=""; process.stdin.on("data", d => s += d); process.stdin.on("end", () => console.log(JSON.parse(s).plugins.updater.pubkey))'
```

With `minisign` available, write the public key and detached signature
to files, then verify:

```sh
minisign -Vm <UPDATE_PAYLOAD_FILE> -P '<PUBLIC_KEY>' -x <SIGNATURE_FILE>
```

If the updater manifest stores the signature inline, copy only that
signature string into a temporary signature file for verification.

## Failure Modes

An install old enough to still trust the DEV pubkey (pre-`3c1435b`,
never bridged) rejects production-signed updater payloads. There is
no auto-update path for it; update it with a manual DMG install.

If update-feed generation or publishing needs GitHub Actions changes,
stop and coordinate with the release owner: workflow files are shared
repo infrastructure, not desktop-local.
