//! Desktop-only config.
//!
//! The chan registry (`~/.chan/config.toml`) is the source of truth
//! for which workspaces exist. This file holds only desktop-specific
//! state that has no place in chan proper:
//!
//! - `outbound`: remote-workspace URLs the user explicitly attached.
//!   The desktop owns only the webview/window state for these
//!   entries, not the remote process or token lifecycle.
//! - `window_configs`: LRU stack of closed-window labels + URL hashes
//!   so a freshly-opened workspace window picks up the panes / tabs /
//!   selections / overlay state of the previous window for that
//!   workspace instead of starting blank.
//!
//! Per-workspace serve URLs are intentionally NOT persisted: chan rotates
//! the bearer token on every `chan open`, so a saved URL would
//! decay to garbage between launches. The URL lives in `AppState`
//! in memory while a serve is running, and the desktop webview
//! reloads it fresh on every On toggle.
