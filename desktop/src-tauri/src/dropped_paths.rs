//! OS file paths for a just-completed drag-drop, read natively.
//!
//! The DOM File API never exposes OS paths (WebKit sanitizes
//! `text/uri-list` for cross-app file drags), and enabling wry's
//! native drag-drop handler would swallow ALL DOM drag events on
//! macOS — wry only forwards a drag to WebKit when the installed
//! handler returns `false`, and tauri-runtime-wry's handler returns
//! `true` unconditionally — killing the editor/file-browser drop
//! zones and in-page tab-move DnD. So the native handler stays
//! disabled (see `build_workspace_window`) and the SPA's terminal
//! drop zone fetches the dropped paths through this command instead:
//! when the DOM `drop` event fires, the macOS drag pasteboard
//! (`NSPasteboard` name `.drag`) still holds the dragged file URLs.
//!
//! Contract (frozen with the web half, task-Chan-ChanDesktop-1):
//! raw absolute paths, pasteboard order, no shell escaping (the SPA
//! escapes); `[]` when the drag carried no file items and
//! unconditionally off macOS (no equivalent persistent drag
//! pasteboard elsewhere; the SPA treats `[]` as a silent no-op).
//! Only meaningful when invoked from inside a `drop` handler: the
//! drag pasteboard is system-wide and persists until the NEXT drag
//! starts. That persistence is also why the ACL scopes this command
//! to LOCALLY-served windows (`workspace-*` / `terminal-*`,
//! capabilities/local-drop.json): a remote-served SPA (`tunnel-*` /
//! `outbound-*`) could otherwise poll it and harvest paths the user
//! drags around in unrelated applications.

/// Read the file paths currently on the macOS drag pasteboard.
/// NSPasteboard is AppKit state, so the read runs on the main thread
/// via `run_on_main_thread`; the command awaits the result over a
