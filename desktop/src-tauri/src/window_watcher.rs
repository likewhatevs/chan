//! The desktop window watcher — chan-desktop as a pure view of the library.
//!
//! Every native window is a reconciled reflection of the library's authoritative
//! window set (Seam W). A `LibraryWatcher` per connected library (the embedded
//! local library + each devserver) holds the latest [`WindowRecord`] snapshot and
//! [`reconcile`]s the native surface to it: open a native window for every library
//! window that lacks one, close every native window the library no longer lists.
//!
//! This replaces the old imperative open/close paths (`reopen_devserver_terminal_
//! windows` / `teardown_devserver_windows` / `track_devserver_window` + the in-memory
//! `devserver_windows` map). Because the reconcile is an idempotent diff keyed by the
//! library-minted id, **reconnect = resubscribe + reconcile can never mint a
//! duplicate** — the L0 always-mint growth path is unreachable by construction.
//!
//! Wiring (lands with G1.5/G2): the local library feeds in-process via
//! `host.assemble_window_records()` + the registry's change `Notify`; a devserver
//! feeds over `GET /api/library/windows` + its watch socket. Both drive the same
//! [`reconcile`]. This module is the surface-agnostic core; the Tauri-side
//! [`NativeSurface`] impl and the per-library watcher tasks bind to it.
//!
//! The reconcile core + loop are consumed by the per-library watcher wiring (the
//! `WindowFeed` impls, the Tauri `NativeSurface` impl, the `watch_loop` spawn) and
//! the L5 close handlers (bury/unbury through the view state).
