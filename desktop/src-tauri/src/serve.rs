//! Per-drive `chan serve` supervisor.
//!
//! For each drive the user toggles On, we spawn `chan serve <path>
//! --host 127.0.0.1 --port N` as a child process, pipe its stderr,
//! and tail it line by line on a dedicated thread. We need the
//! tail thread for two unrelated reasons:
//!
//! 1. chan prints the bound URL on stderr ("chan is ready:" then a
//!    line with the URL). We capture that and stash it in
//!    `AppState.serves` so `list_drives` can hand it to the UI and
//!    the row's Launch button comes alive.
//! 2. When dev mode is on, every line is also forwarded to the
//!    frontend as a `chan-log` event so the console window can
//!    display it.
//!
//! Stop sends SIGTERM with a five-second grace deadline before
//! falling back to SIGKILL (`stop_child`). On Unix every child is
//! placed in its own process group via `CommandExt::process_group`
//! and `stop_child` signals the group so any helper subprocesses
//! chan serve may have spawned die alongside the parent. On
//! Windows the equivalent is the `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
//! creation flag.
//!
//! `AppState::drop` also calls `stop_all` as a defense-in-depth
//! reap path: panics that unwind through `tauri::App` (or any
//! other holder of the Arc) still tear children down even when the
//! Tauri `RunEvent::Exit` hook never fires.
