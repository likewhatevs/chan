# chan-gateway

The self-hostable server side of chan's tunnel: the identity, profile, devserver-control, and devserver-proxy services that sit behind `id.chan.app` and `devserver.chan.app`.

A fleet of `chan devserver` instances dials in over the tunnel and this gateway reverse-proxies each one back out at `{user}.devserver.chan.app/{workspace}/*`, turning them into a portable, multi-device workspace service you run on your own infrastructure (your own "Google Drive / Docs" equivalent, with chan's editor on top).

`chan devserver --tunnel-url` points at a gateway you stand up. `id.chan.app` and `devserver.chan.app` are the maintainer's own deployment of this code, which is experimental, ships with sign-in off by default, and is not a hosted product. Nobody can authenticate until an operator enrols them.

## What's here

Seven crates; see [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the topology and request-flow diagram.

- `profile`: internal HTTP API over Postgres. Users, OAuth identities, devserver grants, feature flags, auth audit.
- `identity`: id.chan.app. OAuth2 sign-in (GitHub / Google / GitLab) with PKCE, Postgres-backed sessions, the embedded SPA, personal access tokens (incl. the `chan://` desktop-authorize consent flow).
- `devserver-control`: singleton, database-free control plane. Owns the dynamic proxy directory, the aggregate tunnel view, fleet admission, and command routing. Serves the `/admin/v1/*` tree on 7003 and the h2c proxy-control listener on 7101.
- `devserver-control-proto`: control protocol frames, validated ids/origins, and shared tunnel/proxy view types.
- `devserver-proxy`: devserver.chan.app. Terminates each `chan devserver`'s yamux tunnel and reverse-proxies it back out at `{user}.devserver.chan.app/{workspace}/*`, behind the always-on devserver-gate (an unauthenticated request 404s like an unknown workspace, so probes can't enumerate). Every registration is admitted by devserver-control before the client sees `HelloAck::Ok`.
- `admin`: operator CLI against profile's and devserver-control's admin trees.
- `gateway-common`: shared library (HTTP clients, devserver-gate JWT, token bucket, static files, validators).

Personal access tokens (PATs, `chan_pat_...`) are the only credential the chan CLI / chan-tunnel side uses; they carry the `tunnel` scope. Adding another OAuth provider is one new file under `crates/identity/src/providers/` plus wiring in `Config::from_env`. Microsoft and Apple are intentionally excluded (Microsoft because tenant admins can mint unverified-email accounts that defeat our email-as-link key; Apple because the OAuth setup is high-touch for the value at this scale).

## Layout

identity's SPA (`@chan/profile`) and the shared chrome (`@chan/web-shared`) live in the `./web` npm workspace at the repo root, so id.chan.app and the editor read as the same product: Svelte 5 + Vite + TypeScript, dark default with the same CSS variable palette.

## Dev

> macOS contributors: the recommended path runs Postgres inside a Lima VM via [sdme][sdme]; see [`docs/dev-setup.md`](docs/dev-setup.md) for the host-side aliases, container layout, and credentials. The rest of this section assumes a Postgres reachable on `127.0.0.1` either way.

[sdme]: https://github.com/fiorix/sdme

### Postgres

One database covers everything; `profile` owns users / identities / workspaces, `identity` owns the `tower_sessions` table. Both auto-migrate on boot.

```sh
createdb chan_gateway
createdb chan_gateway_test         # used by `cargo test`
```

### Frontend

identity's SPA is `@chan/profile`, a member of the `./web` npm workspace at the repo root (alongside `@chan/web-shared`, the shared theme CSS / fetch wrapper / topbar). Build it from there (or `make gateway-spa`):

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run build -w @chan/profile
```

`vite build` writes to `gateway/crates/identity/web/dist/`, embedded by the identity binary via `rust-embed`. devserver-proxy ships no SPA.

### GitHub OAuth app

Register one at https://github.com/settings/developers:

- Homepage URL: `https://id.localtest.me:17000`
- Authorization callback URL: `https://id.localtest.me:17000/auth/github/callback`

Save the client id and secret.

### Run

Use the checked-in local-stack scripts from the repository root. They generate
distinct scoped bearers and Ed25519 admission/entry keypairs, run identity once
with `CHAN_GATEWAY_MIGRATIONS=only`, then start identity and profile with
`CHAN_GATEWAY_MIGRATIONS=external`:

```sh
cp packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/env.example packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/.env
# Add the GitHub OAuth client id and secret to .env.
packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/setup.sh
packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/run.sh
```

Identity serves browser routes on `https://id.localtest.me:17000` through the
generated local TLS edge and exposes its
separate internal proxy/operator listener on `127.0.0.1:17004`. Proxies use
the internal listener for validation. Import
`packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/secrets/tls/ca.crt` into the development browser.
The setup script is idempotent; pass `--force` only when every generated
credential and the local CA should rotate.

devserver-proxy holds no database and reads no identity session, and admits no tunnel until its control session to devserver-control reaches `FleetReady`. Opening a workspace submits a separate, short-lived Ed25519 entry credential to the fixed `/_chan/entry` endpoint in a bounded form POST from identity's exact origin. The credential never appears in a URL and succeeds once; the proxy exchanges it for opaque `__Host-devserver_gate` plus `__Host-devserver_csrf` host-only cookies. For the full local stack use `../packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/setup.sh` + `../packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/run.sh`.

For frontend iteration without re-embedding:

```sh
cd web && npm run dev -w @chan/profile   # :5173, proxies to :7000
```

## Tests

```sh
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://chan:chan@127.0.0.1/chan_gateway
export TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://chan:chan@127.0.0.1/chan_gateway_test
cargo test
```

Tests use real Postgres (per-test schema isolation). Identity tests mock the GitHub OAuth endpoints and profile-service via wiremock.

## Releases

The gateway ships on the monorepo's release line: the gateway crates are versioned in lockstep with the root (`chan`), and a `v*` tag triggers the repo-root `.github/workflows/release.yml`, whose `gateway-linux-packages` job builds five .deb packages (`chan-gateway-profile`, `chan-gateway-identity`, `chan-gateway-devserver-control`, `chan-gateway-devserver-proxy`, `chan-gateway-admin`) for amd64 and arm64 and uploads them alongside the rest of the release.

There is no gateway-local release script: bump `gateway/Cargo.toml` in the same commit as the root `Cargo.toml` version, then cut the release from the monorepo root. The release workflow's `context` job asserts the tag matches the gateway version.

To build .debs locally on macOS (one-off, before relying on CI):

```sh
brew install zig
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
cargo install cargo-zigbuild cargo-deb
../packaging/gateway/scripts/build-debs.sh
ls dist/                                   # ten .deb files (5 packages x 2 archs)
```

### Install on a Debian/Ubuntu host

```sh
sudo apt install ./chan-gateway-profile_*.deb \
                 ./chan-gateway-identity_*.deb \
                 ./chan-gateway-devserver-control_*.deb \
                 ./chan-gateway-devserver-proxy_*.deb
```

Each package has a distinct system user and a service-only env file under
`/etc/chan-gateway/`. Use the repository configurator to create scoped
credentials and the owner-only migration environment, then run the migration
unit before starting the runtime services:

```sh
sudo packaging/gateway/scripts/configure.sh
sudo systemctl restart chan-gateway-migrate
sudo systemctl enable --now chan-gateway-profile
sudo systemctl enable --now chan-gateway-identity
sudo systemctl enable --now chan-gateway-devserver-control
sudo systemctl enable --now chan-gateway-devserver-proxy
```

The binaries listen on loopback by default: identity public `7000`, identity
internal proxy/operator `7004`, profile `7001`, control `7003`/`7101`, and proxy
`7002`/`7100`. Front only identity `7000` and proxy `7002`/`7100` with TLS.
Never publish identity `7004` or either control listener.

## Admin

`chan-gateway-admin` (`crates/admin/`) is the operator CLI: list / block / unblock users, inspect personal access tokens, snapshot or kill live tunnels, read auth audit. It talks to profile-service's `/v1/admin/*` tree and devserver-control's `/admin/v1/*` tree over plain HTTP, so run it on a host that can reach the internal listeners.

### Setup

Each admin destination has its own credential; rotate them independently:

- profile-service:   `PROFILE_ADMIN_TOKEN=<random>`
- identity-service:  `IDENTITY_ADMIN_TOKEN=<random>`
- devserver-control: `DEVSERVER_OPERATOR_ADMIN_TOKENS=<random>`

Do not reuse one bearer across services. `chan-gateway-admin` reads the matching
scoped variable for each destination:

```sh
export CHAN_ADMIN_PROFILE_TOKEN=<PROFILE_ADMIN_TOKEN>
export CHAN_ADMIN_IDENTITY_TOKEN=<IDENTITY_ADMIN_TOKEN>
export CHAN_ADMIN_OPERATOR_TOKEN=<one DEVSERVER_OPERATOR_ADMIN_TOKENS value>
export CHAN_ADMIN_PROFILE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7001    # optional, default
export CHAN_ADMIN_IDENTITY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7004   # optional, internal listener
export CHAN_ADMIN_WORKSPACE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7003  # optional, default
```

Build / install:

```sh
cargo install --path crates/admin                 # local dev
# or use the .deb produced by ../packaging/gateway/scripts/build-debs.sh:
sudo apt install ./chan-gateway-admin_*.deb
```

### Recipes

```sh
# Block a user (revokes every live PAT, refuses fresh OAuth logins)
chan-gateway-admin user block alice@example.com --reason "spam reports"

# Reverse the block (existing tokens stay revoked; reissue if needed)
chan-gateway-admin user unblock alice@example.com

# Audit log for a user (login / logout / login_denied / blocked / ...)
chan-gateway-admin user audit alice@example.com

# Find a user (uuid, email substring, or exact username all work)
chan-gateway-admin user get alice

# List, with filters
chan-gateway-admin user list --blocked
chan-gateway-admin user list --email "@example.com"

# Personal access tokens
chan-gateway-admin token list alice@example.com
chan-gateway-admin token revoke <token-uuid>
chan-gateway-admin token audit  <token-uuid>

# Live tunnels (devserver-control's aggregate fleet view)
chan-gateway-admin tunnel ps
chan-gateway-admin tunnel ps --user alice
chan-gateway-admin tunnel kill alice home          # force one workspace offline
chan-gateway-admin tunnel watch                    # SSE stream, top-style

# Feature flags. Fresh deploys ship oauth_login=off and
# share_workspaces=off so nobody can sign in until you enrol them.
chan-gateway-admin flag list
chan-gateway-admin flag grant oauth_login  alice@example.com
chan-gateway-admin flag grant share_workspaces alice@example.com
chan-gateway-admin flag overrides oauth_login         # who has access
chan-gateway-admin flag revoke share_workspaces alice@example.com
chan-gateway-admin flag create my_feature --default-on --description "..."
```

Add `--json` to any subcommand for jq-friendly output.

The two seeded flags govern the rollout posture. `oauth_login` gates the OAuth callback; an account without the override is denied at sign-in with `?denied=oauth_login` in the redirect. `share_workspaces` is the SPA-side toggle for the per-workspace sharing UI; flipping it off hides the Workspaces tab and the share panel. Both default to off so a fresh deploy has to grant the first user out-of-band (or pre-create users via `chan-gateway-admin user create` and then `flag grant`).

The user account survives a block; deletion is via the SPA's "Delete account" disclosure (account holder only). Account delete also evicts every live tunnel for that user.

## Troubleshooting

- `pool timed out while waiting for an open connection` even though TCP works: Postgres likely ran out of non-superuser connection slots (`FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute`). Restart it (`sudo systemctl restart postgresql`) and re-run. We cap each service at 4 connections, but leftover pools from prior runs + test crashes can pile up.
- `Access to localhost was denied` / 403 on macOS port 7000: AirPlay Receiver claims that port. Disable it in System Settings -> General -> AirDrop & Handoff, or change `BIND_ADDR` / `BASE_URL` to a different port (and re-register the OAuth callback URL).
