//! Process-wide reaper for leaked Postgres connections in test runs.
//!
//! Test binaries that open many per-test pools against the same
//! database role can run pg out of non-superuser connection slots:
//! sqlx pools don't always drop cleanly on cargo-test panic / abort,
//! so a flaky run leaves N idle connections behind under the same
//! role. Subsequent runs hit `PoolTimedOut` (sqlx's surfacing of
//! "remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the
//! SUPERUSER attribute").
//!
//! Mitigation: hold one durable connection for the lifetime of the
//! test process. PG 13+ lets a non-superuser `pg_terminate_backend`
//! peer sessions owned by the same role, so the held connection can
//! reap idle leftovers from previous runs the first time it is
//! created. Once held, the connection is never dropped, so the role
//! never goes idle for this process either.
//!
//! Included via `#[path = "../../../tests-shared/pg_reaper.rs"]
//! mod pg_reaper;` from each integration-test entry. Not a real
//! crate; the path lives outside any cargo-discovered tests dir so
//! cargo never tries to compile it on its own.
//!
//! Hard exhaustion is the one case this cannot recover. If even one
//! `chan` slot is unavailable at startup we cannot open the durable
//! connection and the reap query never runs; the caller will see a
//! clean panic and `docs/dev-setup.md` documents the manual reap.
