# Gateway

The account, sign-in, and reverse-proxy surface for chan.app, a separate nested Cargo workspace. This glossary fixes the domain language; decisions and their rationale live in `docs/adr/`.

`admin-service` is the operator console; `gateway-common` holds the `devserver_gate` JWT type and the profile/devserver-control clients. devserver-control owns the aggregate `/admin/v1/*` tree: identity, profile, and the admin CLI read one coherent fleet view from it, and every tunnel admission is its decision. devserver-proxy renders no UI of its own -- it forwards the launcher that the devserver serves at its root.

## The devserver model

**devserver**:
The single, gateway-exposed `chan devserver` process a user runs; it hosts a library and holds one tunnel registration. One per user is reachable through the gateway at a time.
_Avoid_: remote, instance, node

**library**:
The set of workspaces a devserver hosts (the `~/.chan` workspace registry on that machine). The devserver is the process; the library is its contents.
_Avoid_: collection, registry

**workspace**:
A single project directory; the tenant unit inside a library. It is not a permission or sharing unit.
_Avoid_: project, folder, drive

**tenant**:
A workspace as routed and served inside the devserver, mounted at a route slug.
_Avoid_: site, app

## Gate and identity

**devserver-proxy**:
The gateway reverse-proxy service at `devserver.chan.app` (apex) and `*.devserver.chan.app` (wildcard), and the fleet data plane: many provisioned nodes can run it, each with a stable node id. Renamed from workspace-proxy.
_Avoid_: workspace-proxy, tenant-proxy

**devserver-control**:
The singleton, database-free control plane. Owns the dynamic proxy directory, the aggregate tunnel view, fleet admission, and command routing; serves `/admin/v1/*` to identity, profile, and the admin CLI. Every proxy node holds one authenticated h2 control session to it.
_Avoid_: controller-service, fleet-db

**devserver token**:
The owner PAT (`chan_pat_*`) that authorizes a devserver to register over the tunnel. One token identifies one devserver; the backend resolves the devserver from the token's hash. The PAT stays opaque.
_Avoid_: tunnel-name, api-key

**devserver_gate**:
The host-only JWT-cookie access gate on the wildcard host. Gates per devserver: the `drv` claim is the devserver, the cookie is scoped `Path=/`, and there is one access check. Renamed from workspace_gate.
_Avoid_: workspace_gate, auth-cookie

**devserver grant**:
A profile record that a caller may access an owner's devserver, meaning its whole library. The sharing unit. Replaces the per-workspace grant.
_Avoid_: workspace-grant, share, ACL

**entry token**:
The short-lived `?t=` JWT that identity mints after a devserver access check, which devserver-proxy exchanges for the `devserver_gate` session cookie.
_Avoid_: handoff-token
