# devserver-control

Singleton, database-free control plane for the devserver-proxy fleet. Owns the dynamic proxy directory, the aggregate tunnel view, fleet admission, and kill-command routing. Every devserver-proxy node holds one authenticated h2c control session to it on a dedicated listener; identity, profile, and the admin CLI read one coherent fleet view from its `/admin/v1/*` tree. No SPA, no database, no tenant traffic: the controller carries metadata and commands only.

## Role in the system

devserver-proxy keeps its registrations in a process-local registry, so with more than one proxy node nothing in the fleet can answer "who holds this tunnel" or "how many devservers does this user run." devserver-control is that answer. Each proxy publishes a full registry snapshot plus deltas over its control session, asks the controller for an admission decision before acknowledging any tunnel registration, and executes the controller's kill commands. Consumers point `DEVSERVER_ADMIN_URL` at this service and always see either one coherent fleet view or an explicit upstream failure, never a partial process snapshot. The split and its failure semantics are decided in [ADR-0002](../../docs/adr/0002-control-plane-owns-proxy-fleet-state.md).

## Build

```bash
cargo build -p devserver-control
```

The binary is `devserver-control-service`. No frontend: devserver-control ships no SPA.

## Dev run

```bash
export BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7003
export PROXY_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7101
export DEVSERVER_OPERATOR_ADMIN_TOKENS=operator-token-32-bytes-minimum-000
export DEVSERVER_IDENTITY_ADMIN_TOKENS=identity-token-32-bytes-minimum-000
export DEVSERVER_PROFILE_ADMIN_TOKENS=profile-token-32-bytes-minimum-0000
export DEVSERVER_PROXY_CREDENTIALS='p1=proxy-token-32-bytes-minimum-000000'
readarray -t admission_keys < <(python3 packaging/gateway/scripts/generate-admission-keypair.py)
export DEVSERVER_ADMISSION_VERIFYING_KEYS="${admission_keys[1]}"
export DEVSERVER_PROXY_BASE_URL_TEMPLATE='http://{proxy_id}.devserver.localtest.me:7002'
cargo run -p devserver-control
```

For the full local stack (with identity + profile + Postgres), prefer `packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/setup.sh` + `packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/run.sh`. Two listeners come up:

- `BIND_ADDR` (7003): admin HTTP. `/healthz` and `/readyz` are unauthenticated; `/admin/v1/*` is Bearer-gated by route-scoped operator, identity, and profile credentials.
- `PROXY_BIND_ADDR` (7101): h2c. Each devserver-proxy node dials `POST /v1/proxies/connect` with its proxy-id-scoped credential and holds the stream for the life of its control session.

Both listeners must be loopback unless the deployment explicitly sets `CHAN_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TRANSPORT=overlay-encrypted`; that value is an assertion that the surrounding network provides confidentiality and peer isolation for these cleartext HTTP/h2c listeners.

The template must expand each proxy's `DEVSERVER_PROXY_ID` to exactly that node's `DEVSERVER_PROXY_BASE_URL`; a mismatch closes the control session at the handshake. With the dev values above, a proxy runs with `DEVSERVER_PROXY_ID=p1` and `DEVSERVER_PROXY_BASE_URL=http://p1.devserver.localtest.me:7002`.

## Env vars

Required:

| Name                                | Notes                             |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `DEVSERVER_OPERATOR_ADMIN_TOKENS`   | one or two rotating full-access Bearers |
| `DEVSERVER_IDENTITY_ADMIN_TOKENS`   | one or two rotating identity-scoped Bearers |
| `DEVSERVER_PROFILE_ADMIN_TOKENS`    | one or two rotating profile-scoped Bearers |
| `DEVSERVER_PROXY_CREDENTIALS`       | `proxy_id=token` allowlist; up to two per id |
| `DEVSERVER_ADMISSION_VERIFYING_KEYS` | one or two rotating Ed25519 public keys |
| `DEVSERVER_PROXY_BASE_URL_TEMPLATE` | one `{proxy_id}` origin template  |

Optional:

| Name                      | Default          | Purpose                      |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| `BIND_ADDR`               | `127.0.0.1:7003` | admin listener               |
| `PROXY_BIND_ADDR`         | `127.0.0.1:7101` | proxy control listener (h2c) |
| `MAX_DEVSERVERS_PER_USER` | `100`            | positive fleet-wide per-owner cap |
| `CHAN_GATEWAY_INTERNAL_TRANSPORT` | unset | set exactly `overlay-encrypted` only behind a protected overlay |
| `RUST_LOG`                | `info`           | tracing filter               |

Every credential is visible ASCII, 32–256 bytes, and credentials may not be reused across proxy ids or admin scopes. Rotation accepts at most two values per authority.

## Routes

Admin listener (`BIND_ADDR`); all `/admin/v1/*` routes Bearer-gated and scope-checked:

| Method | Path                                         | Purpose             |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| GET    | `/healthz`                                   | liveness; no auth   |
| GET    | `/readyz`                                    | 503 while warming   |
| GET    | `/admin/v1/tunnels`                          | aggregate tunnels   |
| GET    | `/admin/v1/tunnels/watch`                    | SSE snapshot stream |
| POST   | `/admin/v1/tunnels/{owner_user_id}/{devserver_id}/kill` | exact kill; 204 |
| GET    | `/admin/v1/owners/{owner_user_id}/tunnels`   | one owner's indexed rows |
| POST   | `/admin/v1/owners/{owner_user_id}/tunnels/kill` | owner-wide kill |
| POST   | `/admin/v1/sessions/revoke`                  | exact or subject session revocation |
| GET    | `/admin/v1/proxies`                          | proxy directory     |
| GET    | `/admin/v1/proxies/watch`                    | SSE proxy stream    |

Proxy listener (`PROXY_BIND_ADDR`):

| Method | Path                  | Purpose                            |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/v1/proxies/connect` | raw h2c control stream per proxy   |

Aggregate reads return 503 until the controller is ready (a full convergence window plus reconciliation; see [`design.md`](design.md)). Kills route by registration UUID to the owning proxy only. Session revocation returns a partial 502 unless every connected proxy confirms bridge drain and no retained disconnected authority is unreachable. See [`design.md`](design.md) for lease authority, session lifecycle, resource/rate bounds, reconciliation, and command semantics.
