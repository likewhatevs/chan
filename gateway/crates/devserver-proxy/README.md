# devserver-proxy

Public-facing service at devserver.chan.app (apex) and `*.devserver.chan.app` (wildcard). Reverse-proxies HTTP / WebSocket traffic into a user's running `chan devserver` instances. Embeds `chan-tunnel-server` to terminate registrations from those instances on a separate h2c listener; every registration is admitted by devserver-control before the client sees `HelloAck::Ok`. No SPA or database; proxy-local browser sessions and entry replay state are bounded in-memory state.

## Role in the system

devserver-proxy is the surface where a devserver is served in the browser. It does NOT read identity's `id_session` cookie. Identity mints a short-lived Ed25519 entry credential and hands it to `POST /_chan/entry` in a request body. The proxy verifies it (signature + issuer + exact audience + proxy id + devserver id + signed clean path), consumes its replay id, and mints a bounded opaque host-only `Path=/` `devserver_gate` cookie. Authenticated traffic then reaches the exact `chan devserver` peer through its live yamux tunnel. No entry credential appears in a navigation URL.

## Build

```bash
cargo build -p devserver-proxy
```

No frontend: devserver-proxy ships no SPA.

## Dev run

```bash
export BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7002
export TUNNEL_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1:7100
export IDENTITY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7004
export IDENTITY_INTERNAL_TOKEN=dev-internal-token
export DEVSERVER_ENTRY_VERIFYING_KEYS=<base64-ed25519-public-key>
export IDENTITY_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:7000
export DASHBOARD_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7000/workspaces
export DEVSERVER_CONTROL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7200
export DEVSERVER_PROXY_TOKEN=dev-proxy-token
export DEVSERVER_PROXY_ID=p1
export DEVSERVER_PROXY_BASE_URL=http://devserver.localtest.me:7002
export DEVSERVER_TUNNEL_ORIGIN=http://devserver.localtest.me:7100
cargo run -p devserver-proxy
```

For the full local stack (with identity + profile + Postgres), prefer `packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/setup.sh` + `packaging/gateway/scripts/dev/run.sh`. Two listeners come up:

- `BIND_ADDR` (7002): public HTTP. devserver.chan.app sits behind nginx + TLS in production; loopback in dev.
- `TUNNEL_BIND_ADDR` (7100): h2c. nginx `grpc_pass`es `/v1/tunnel` on the apex here; `chan devserver` instances dial it for the handshake.

| `SESSION_MAX_ACTIVE`       | `10000`                  | process-wide opaque-session cap |
| `SESSION_LIFETIME_SECS`    | `3600`                   | opaque-session lifetime (max 1h) |
| `ENTRY_REPLAY_MAX_ACTIVE`  | `10000`                  | active entry-replay cap |

## Routes

- Apex (`devserver.<domain>`): `POST /v1/tunnel` (raw h2c, on the tunnel listener), `/healthz`, and `/readyz`. `/readyz` is 200 only once the controller session reaches `FleetReady`; until then new tunnel admissions are refused with the `control_unavailable` code. Per-user devserver capacity is a fleet-wide decision made by the controller at admission and surfaces as `too_many_workspaces`. The aggregate `/admin/v1/*` tree lives on devserver-control, not on the proxy.
- Wildcard (`{user}--{disc}.devserver.<domain>` addressing one devserver by the first 12 hex chars of its id): the per-devserver reverse proxy. `POST /_chan/entry` exchanges a body credential; ordinary paths require the opaque `devserver_gate` cookie. On pass the full `/{workspace}/...` path is forwarded into the tunnel (segment-preserving) and the devserver routes the tenant. `/api/devserver/*` (the local-only management API) is 404'd here.
