//! Devserver registry sweeper.
//!
//! Identity mints one `devservers` row per PAT (the devserver id is
//! the SHA-256 of the raw token) and nothing deletes them: PAT
//! rotation strands the old row forever, so the dashboard lists every
//! devserver ever registered. The sweeper keeps the registry honest:
//! each tick stamps `last_seen_at` on the rows that are live right now
//! (devserver-control's aggregate tunnel snapshot) and deletes rows
//! offline longer than the configured retention, where offline age is
//! `now() - COALESCE(last_seen_at, created_at)`.
//!
//! Fail-safe rule (load-bearing, test-pinned): a tick that cannot
//! fetch the live-tunnel snapshot marks and deletes NOTHING. Marking
//! runs strictly before deletion inside a tick, so rows only age
//! toward deletion while ticks are succeeding -- a devserver-control
//! outage longer than the retention cannot wipe a live registry.
//!
//! Comeback semantics: deletion cascades the row's grants away
//! (`devserver_grants` FK); grants stay gone until re-granted. A
//! swept devserver that redials announces its display name in the
//! tunnel `Hello`, and identity's validate exchange recreates the row
//! with that label on the spot. A client that announces no name shows
//! up live-unlabeled on the owner's dashboard (the live list comes
//! from devserver-control's aggregate) until the next grant create or
//! identity mint recreates its row. The owner's own entry and open
//! flow never break: owner-side access checks never read the
//! `devservers` table.
//!
//! Fleet coverage: the snapshot is devserver-control's cluster-wide
//! aggregate, so registrations on every connected proxy count as live.
//!
//! The loop runs detached for the life of the process (spawned from
//! `run()` in main before serve); process shutdown is its cancellation
//! path.
